I saw there's another PR out for a similar thing, but I just hacked this in a couple of hours today for fun and it's working so far. Have some tests left to write.

Sorry didn't get a chance to review this, but it's on my list of things to check in on after the break!

No worries! It's not as high a priority. I think I'll schedule a day to carry this over the line.

Hello! I am wondering what is the latest here! It's referenced in an issue that's now closed because this was a PR almost ready to go! No rush here, just trying to get a sense if we can have a quick win here, since the majority of the work seems to be done.

A version of this has been released in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/releases/tag/v0.14.0 so going to close this out.
