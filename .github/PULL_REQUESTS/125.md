> @brikis98 @yorinasub17 Please review and check this PR and see if meets expectation. I also kindly request that you don't snooze it like [125](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/125).

I think you clearly meant this PR - https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/114 which has the aforementioned comment on delayed review. 

@alexkayabula - I have also put in personal time and weekends to contribute to open source. While I understand the review delay from the project maintainers as they might have other priorities, seeing someone make an example of that delay is plain hurtful and derides my contribution. Not cool and totally uncalled for.

Attaching screenshot of the edited comment - as I suspected that instead of engaging to resolve the point I raised  - my concern would be totally ignored and the comment deleted/edited.

Hey folks, we're doing the best we can. I understand you're frustrated at the delays, but I kindly request that you don't take it out on us. Like everyone else, we're doing our best to balance open source maintenance, with running and growing a small business, and all this amidst COVID-19, which, for many people, has affected available hours (e.g., some of the maintainers have families who are now at home all day and, I hope you agree, take higher priority than responding to issues/PRs).

Not sure why you felt the need for the screenshot. @alexkayabula edited his own comment (see the comment history). We've never edited or deleted other people's comments and, in general, have a [strong dedication to transparency and honesty](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-we-built-a-distributed-self-funded-family-friendly-profitable-startup-93635feb5ace), so it's not clear where this comes from. 

We greatly appreciate your contributions and we'll incorporate them as soon as we can. In the meantime, grab a üç∫ or ‚òï, relax, and try to keep the conversation positive üëç

@saurabh-hirani I honestly understand the frustration but I suspect that @brikis98 and @yorinasub17 could be tigthly engaged at the moment. @brikis98 usually promptly reviews other open source projects like [terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) that I have been contributing to. Lets try to keep the conversation positive and fun.

I am all for positivity - having the opportunity to contribute to open source is a privilege and to engage with the best minds in the industry even more so. I look up to the work that Gruntwork does and can only aspire to be emulate their level of work. 

Also the point isn't about delayed reviews - I am fine with a delayed review as I called in my original comment. I go through Gruntwork's monthly newsletter and it's amazing how they contribute so much to open source while creating production grade Terraform modules.  I just felt calling out my contribution to push a case (as in @alexkayabula original comment) was not cool. The original comment was edited and I meant that Alex edited it instead of addressing the point I raised and I didn't mean anything else. I mentioned that as it would be easier to just keep the original comment as is and engage. But eitherways, I would want to bury the hatchet and move on. Thanks for addressing this @brikis98 and sorry for digressing this thread from a tech review. Cheers! üçª

@brikis98 @yorinasub17 is it possible to get access to the nuclear wasteland account so that I can test out this feature.
Thank you.

@alexkayabula Unfortunately, that is a private Gruntwork account, and we only give employees access to it. AWS does offer a free tier, so if you spin up a new account, and stick to the smallest RDS instance types, or even serverless, I don't think it should cost anything...

Giving this one a bump. It might be easiest to close this PR & revive it once we're in a good place to pick this issue up #120.

Closing this PR as it hasn't had activity in a while and will likely be easier to re-implement. Feel free to re-open at a later date.
