# Add defaults-aws subcommand

**bwhaley** commented *Aug 14, 2019*

This PR adds a new subcommand, `cloud-nuke defaults-aws`. The command does the following:
* Discovers and removes all default VPCs from an account
* Discovers all default security groups and removes their default ingress/egress rules

#### Background
New AWS accounts have a [Default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html) in each region. If you create a resource (e.g. an EC2 instance) without specifying a VPC ID and subnet, it will be created within the default VPC by default. For production accounts, indeed for any account which is used for purposes other than simple sandbox tests, the default VPC can be considered a risk as it may accumulate unused/undesired resources over time.

Additional, all VPCs, not just default VPCs, include a default security group. The default security group has an ingress rule that allows all traffic within the same group, and an egress rule that permits all outbound traffic (e.g. all ports, all protocols, to destination `0.0.0.0/0`). This is an antipattern for obvious reasons. Removing this rule is a requirement for compliance with some security standards, such as the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.

#### Usage
I've added the `defaults-aws` subcommand to remove these defaults. Example output:

The only supported flag is `--force` to allow for non-interactive use. 

#### Testing
One challenge with this change was that many of the tests rely on the presence of a default VPC and/or security group to function. e.g. new EC2 instances, when launched by the tests, are launched in to the default VPC. This command removes the default VPC. Furthermore, any other activities in the same account, such as tests from other code repositories, would have issues.

Therefore I used the `ec2iface.EC2API` and the [GoMock](https://github.com/golang/mock) framework to mock the APIs for this testing. This was a cumbersome effort and required quite a lot of code, but the end result is that we have thorough testing for this change without impacting "real" AWS resources.

#### Closing
Please give this a careful review. The nature of this command is destructive, obviously - deleting VPCs and security groups. I've tested it myself, but bugs in this feature could be very costly.

Thanks for the review.

I'm open to ideas on how to include integration tests as that's my preference as well. In fact, you may have noticed that I actually wrote integration tests before I realized that it would break other tests that run in parallel. Then I realized that it might also run in parallel with other test/work in the same AWS account that also depends on default VPCs. Given the distributed nature of the tests and multiple parallel uses of an account, I can't really see a good way to do integration testing of this feature (other than having it spin up a separate account and do stuff there as you suggested we might do for the other compliance work).

I think Jim mentioned that we can't quite do this in an automated test because of how hard it is to shut down an account (requires email verification and what not). Otherwise, I would have suggested adding it in here.

We may want to discuss how best to do it with the broader team, perhaps in an IaC team meeting or async via slack.

In any case, the mock testing is better than no tests :)

Thanks for the review! Merging and releasing this one.
