Thanks for the review,

It should be noted that the EC2 Instance filter in this PR also looks at instance name and not instance ID. I was referencing the existing NAT Gateway implementation which shows the resource ID in the output but filters based on Name therefore didn't expect this to be an issue.

@tonerdo Is this a topic that is up for discussion? In my experience with Cloud Nuke there is _significant_ utility in being able to use a regex pattern to match a resource name and not just specify individual resource IDs. Especially in an IaC controlled environment where resources may be spun up and down, changing the underlying instance ID but retaining the same Name value. 

If this is a hard rule not up for discussion then I will make the requested changes and also open an issue to request README updates that clarify the "Names" pattern filter does not actually filter the resource names but instead filters the AWS Resource ID (and only in some cases) as it is not clear.

@brandonstrohmeyer you're right. I looked through the codebase and founds other examples. This PR is good to go
