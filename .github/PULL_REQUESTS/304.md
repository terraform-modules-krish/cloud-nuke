# feat: add kinesis stream support

**strongishllama** commented *May 26, 2022*

## Description

This pull request adds support for nuking Kinesis Stream as mentioned in #301. I'll bring in Kinesis Firehose support in another pull request when I get a bit more time.

I pretty much just translated the work done in this [pull request](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/289/files) and applied it to Kinesis Streams so please let me know if anything is incorrect style/logic wise 😄 

Tests in the `kinesis_stream_test.go` are passing as well as when you run the CLI with `go run main.go aws --resource-type kinesis-stream`.

Docs have been updated to show the Kinesis Stream support.

Because this is adding support for a new resource this pull request will introduce breaking changes as per [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/a696846eadb65719badc5bc56706a9c8a9b91292/README.md#choosing-a-new-release-tag)

My apologies, I've just had a closer look at the diff and it seems that when I saved in my IDE `gofumpt` has made a couple of unintended style changes in `aws/aws.go`, please let me know if you'd like them reverted!

@denis256 My bad, small logic error. Should be good to go now.

Hi,
after re-run tests seems to pass, however appeared conflicts on files:
```
README.md
aws/aws.go
```

**strongishllama** commented *Jul 7, 2022*

@denis256 Conflicts have been fixed 👍

@denis256 Sorry to keep nagging but do you think this is good to go now? 😅

Looks like after merge build is failing:
```
Stderr: go: downloading github.com/konsorten/go-windows-terminal-sequences v1.0.3
# github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/aws
aws/aws.go:724:40: use of package session without selector
```

Hi,
looks like with recent changes are conflicting files:
```
README.md
aws/aws.go
config/config.go
config/config_test.go
```
