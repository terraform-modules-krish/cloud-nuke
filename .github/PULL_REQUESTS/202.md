# Add functionality to nuke AWS IAM Access Analyzers

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 23, 2021*

We hit limits in our testing account for the multi region IAM Access Analyzers module, so I decided to use `cloud-nuke` to clear house and get a feature out of it. This PR was used to clear out residual access analyzers in our test account.
