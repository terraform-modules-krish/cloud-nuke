# Ignore errors

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 30, 2020*

By default `cloud-nuke` will halt processing if it encounters any error with nuking a region or resource, instead of
continuing to process additional resources. This PR introduces a new CLI flag (`--ignore-errrors`) to inform `cloud-nuke` to ignore errors and continue processing, but aggregate the errors at the end so the overall command still exists with a non-zero exit code.

Ahhhh I somehow missed that PR. Will close this and if necessary, extend that PR.
