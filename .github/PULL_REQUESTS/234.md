# Nuke EKS compute resources

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 12, 2021*

Fixes https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/111 and https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/148

In my monthly AWS bill investigation, I keep having to manually nuke EKS clusters with clickops in our accounts that have Fargate Profiles or Node Groups and I don't want to do that anymore. This PR updates the EKS nuke routine to clean up those compute resources so that the EKS cluster can be nuked.

Note that in order to do so, I had to bump the AWS SDK version, which in turn meant that the mocks needed to be refreshed. That's where the changes to `aws/mocks/EC2API.go` is coming from.
