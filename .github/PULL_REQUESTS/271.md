# Include OpenID Connect Providers to nukable resource

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 14, 2022*

This adds IAM OpenID Connect Provider for nuking consideration. I implemented this to clean up residule OIDC providers in `phxdevops` since that caused us to reach AWS limits there in our testing.

I kicked off another test run and sadly got more errors. It would be nice to also figure out the flakiness. I don't mind looking into that later.

Thanks for review! I took a look at the remaining failing test and they are unrelated to this PR, so I will go ahead and merge this in.
