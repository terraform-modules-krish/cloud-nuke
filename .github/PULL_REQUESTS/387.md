## Description

I noticed there were some more buckets accumulating in phx devops account that were not listed here. So I added some more patterns to this list. I don't know where some of these buckets are coming from because they are from repos I don't have access to, so please do a sanity check if this list seems reasonable.

Also added some log group tests that were not in the list.

## TODOs

Read the [Gruntwork contribution guidelines](https://gruntwork.notion.site/Gruntwork-Coding-Methodology-02fdcd6e4b004e818553684760bf691e).

- [x] Attention Grunts - if this PR adds support for a new resource, ensure the `nuke_sandbox` and `nuke_phxdevops` jobs in `.circleci/config.yml` have been updated with appropriate exclusions (either directly in the job or via the `.circleci/nuke_config.yml` file) to prevent nuking IAM roles, groups, resources, etc that are important for the test accounts.
