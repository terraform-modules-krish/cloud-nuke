# Fix AuthFailure Error

**tonerdo** commented *Feb 21, 2019*

This PR fixes the constant `AuthFailure: AWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials` errors when running tests. It turns out that AWS added a new GovCloud region `us-gov-east-1` which I wasn't explicitly ignoring as I did the China and other GovCloud regions.

The simple change was to add `us-gov-east-1` to the `reservedRegions` array so we don't try to get resources from it
