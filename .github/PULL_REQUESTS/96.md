# Adding S3 nuke support

**saurabh-hirani** commented *Feb 29, 2020*

This PR adds support to delete S3 buckets as requested in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/58 

It ensures that the AWS S3 list bucket operation - which lists all buckets irrespective of region - is not called multiple times for each region and uses cached entries as highlighted in the above issue discussion. 

Deletion also uses ```WaitUntilBucketNotExists``` to ensure bucket is deleted. It also supports edge cases where in bucket is deleted by some other means after listing but before deletion.

**Demo:**

1. Added s3 to list of resources

```
go run main.go aws --list-resource-types | grep s3

s3
```

2. Run S3 related tests:

```
go test -run S3 -v ./...

TestNukeS3Buckets - creates, deletes and verifies S3 bucket deletion - it also tries to delete the same bucket twice to try out the case of bucket present during listing but deleted by some other means before deletion through cloud-nuke.

3. Run S3 deletion with dry run:

4. Run S3 deletion without dry-run:

```

go run main.go aws --resource-type s3 --region ap-northeast-1

THE NEXT STEPS ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND COMPLETELY IRREVERSIBLE, PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!!

Thanks for the feedback @yorinasub17 and @brikis98. I will make the changes and update this thread.

**saurabh-hirani** commented *Mar 4, 2020*

@yorinasub17 @brikis98 - updated as per feedback with 2 items pending. Highlights:

Done:

1. Refactored ```s3_test.go``` to have separate tests for nuking empty bucket, bucket with items.
3. Refactored ```s3.go``` accordingly and cleaned up main nukeAllS3Buckets function to call ```nukeAllS3BucketObjects``` and ```nukeEmptyS3Bucket```. Removed ```checkS3BucketExists```
3. Updated ```aws.go``` as per nit-pick feedback. 

Pending:

1. Current code does not support deleting versioned bucket with objects. I couldn't find a good batch delete way for versioned buckets. Will probably detect bucket versioning on/off and use right type of nuking.
2. Preventing deletion based on hard coded tag means adding metadata to the buckets returned by ```getAllS3Buckets``` to know bucket properties. As it is to find if bucket is versioned or not, we will have to add that metadata.

Will work on the pending items and update.

Updated codebase as per the above feedback. Deleting S3 buckets now has the following features:

1. Support to delete empty, non-empty and versioned buckets.
2. Ability to filter out buckets tagged with "cloud-nuke-excluded=true" flag. 
3. Batched deletion and deletion as per max AWS limits (1000 objects per deletion run). The batched deletion number is internal to the code and is not exposed to the end user.
4. Deleting buckets having specific substring in their name. This feature is also internal to the code and is not exposed to the end user. It was added to make testing easier. 

All the above features have been verified via the following test cases. All the tests try to ensure deletion of the bucket in the end - hence there are some messages which are errors related to deleting non existent buckets but they are not tied to test failure. 

1. List S3 buckets for deletion without filter tag (cloud-nuke-excluded=true):

```

@brikis98 @yorinasub17  - can you please review the code and let me know if this looks good?

@yorinasub17 @brikis98  - squashed the commits related to DeleteMarker, shouldIncludeBucket and single call for getting all objects and versions as per feedback. Can you please review it and let me know if it looks good?

Found a bug - if the passed in session object to ```getAllS3Buckets``` is different from bucket's target region - then the call to get bucket tags fails because it expects the S3 client to be in target region. Hence added code to maintain an internal cache of reusable per region s3 clients while collecting the buckets and updated test cases to pass in random sessions to test scenarios where default region != target bucket region. This bug was undetected till now because in the test cases we were passing in sessions which were same as bucket's target region. Also renamed  ```session``` var to ```awsSession``` to avoid confusion with the ```session``` package of the SDK.

Will squash the fix once https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/96/commits/fa6eb0c6cc67f7691b5f20129dbf706f740ec791 is reviewed.

Thanks for working through the fixes! I am a bit buried right now to take a look, but will try to carve out time before the end of the week. Thanks for your patience!

@brikis98 @yorinasub17 - just wanted to follow up on this and wanted to know if it looks good. Btw, checked AWS landing zone - looks great.

@saurabh-hirani sorry haven't had a chance to take a look yet, but this hasn't dropped off my radar. Should have time to look in the next few days.

@yorinasub17 updated as per feedback. Please check the latest commit and if it looks good - I will squash the changes so that it can be merged. 
***

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 1, 2020*

No need to squash! This looks ready to merge once the tests pass, but as mentioned this will break our environment so I needed to extend it in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/101.

Note that this PR will autoclose as merged when that PR merges (because all the commits are still there).

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 2, 2020*

Thanks for sticking with this! This is now merged and released as https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/releases/tag/v0.1.17. Binaries will show up shortly.
