# Support AWS Config

**ekristen** commented *Nov 16, 2021*

This implements nuking AWS Config Rules, but excludes any generated internally by AWS that can't be removed. These generally are prefixed with `aws-service-rule`

- Resolves https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/69

Thank you for your contribution, Erik!

The files are missing a `config_test.go`.  You can check out the `aws/*_test.go` for examples. We create these tests where we (1) create the resource, (2) delete it and (3) confirm that the resource was deleted.

Thanks again for your contribution! I wanted to let you know that we've now got support for AWS config recorders and rules in cloud-nuke as of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/405

Therefore, I'm going to close out this PR.
