Thank you for the PR! Apologies for the long delay. We are very overloaded at the moment. We'll try to get this reviewed as soon as we can!

Any update here?

LGTM! Can you just rebase from master and fix the conflict in go.sum? I'm kicking off tests, and if those pass we'll be ready to merge.

**bwhaley** commented *Mar 29, 2021*

Reminder that we're ready to merge this once go.sum is caught up to the master branch!
