Change the order of cloud-nuke to delete IAM policy first before IAM groups

<!-- Prepend '[WIP]' to the title if this PR is still a work-in-progress. Remove it when it is ready for review! -->

## Description

Fixes https://gruntwork.atlassian.net/browse/CORE-330.

## Testing
* Created a test IAM policy and IAM group via AWS UI
* Inspected that both element exist by running the command: 

```
aws-vault exec demo-logs -- ./cloud-nuke inspect-aws --resource-type iam-policy --resource-type iam-group
```
* Ran the cloud-nuke command to delete both resources at the same time: 

```
aws-vault exec demo-logs -- ./cloud-nuke aws --resource-type iam-group --resource-type iam-policy 
```

Final confirmation from the cloud-nuke CLI:

* Checked the AWS UI and verified both resources have been deleted successfully. 
Also, tested inline group policy deletion as well by manually creating an inline group policy AWS UI:

> This was an issue with inline polices on the IAM group, can you add a test for that?

Hmm I tried to look through the API documentation and existing set of tests in the code base, but it doesn't seem like there's a way to create IAM group with inline policy. For instance, if we look at the input struct, it doesn't provide option to create inline policy: 

```
type AttachGroupPolicyInput struct {
	_ struct{} `type:"structure"`

	// The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the group to attach the policy to.
	//
	// This parameter allows (through its regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex))
	// a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters
	// with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-
	//
	// GroupName is a required field
	GroupName *string `min:"1" type:"string" required:"true"`

	// The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy you want to attach.
	//
	// For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
	// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
	//
	// PolicyArn is a required field
	PolicyArn *string `min:"20" type:"string" required:"true"`
}
```

Also the CreateGroup request struct: 

```
type CreateGroupInput struct {
	_ struct{} `type:"structure"`

	// The name of the group to create. Do not include the path in this value.
	//
	// IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account.
	// Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources
	// named both "MyResource" and "myresource".
	//
	// GroupName is a required field
	GroupName *string `min:"1" type:"string" required:"true"`

	// The path to the group. For more information about paths, see IAM identifiers
	// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html)
	// in the IAM User Guide.
	//
	// This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash
	// (/).
	//
	// This parameter allows (through its regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex))
	// a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself
	// or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
	// can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character
	// (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased
	// letters.
	Path *string `min:"1" type:"string"`
}
```

I can test this manually via the AWS UI and update the description above.

Updated. Let me know if there's anything I missed!

I think you can use `PutGroupPolicy` for creating inline policies

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/iam#Client.PutGroupPolicy
