LGTM as well! I'll kick off a sanity check regression build now and if that passes, we can merge this in! Thanks for your contribution!

Build failed, but it's for an unrelated resource test, so it effectively passed. However, as mentioned on the ELBv2 version of this (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/261), there is a merge conflict, so consider combining the two PRs together.

I opened #266 as a combined PR. Originally I wasn't sure if it was better to submit each individual config file "feature" as an individual PR, but it seems that creates more problems than it solves so will lean toward larger PRs in the future. 

Thanks!
