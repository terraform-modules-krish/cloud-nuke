# Fix CircleCI Contexts

**zackproser** commented *Nov 12, 2020*

This pull request was programmatically opened by the multi-repo-updater program. It should be adding the 'Gruntwork Admin' context to any Workflows -> Jobs nodes and should also be leaving the rest of the .circleci/config.yml file alone. 

 This PR was opened so that all our repositories' .circleci/config.yml files can be converted to use the same CircleCI context, which will make rotating secrets much easier in the future.

Preparing to re-run the batch that includes this repo now that the bugs have been fixed.
