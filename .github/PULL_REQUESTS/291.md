# Filter VPCs by name instead of VPC ID

**brandonstrohmeyer** commented *Mar 17, 2022*

Fixes #288 

* Move VPC tagging logic outside of filter function, allows for easier testing of `shouldIncludeVpc`
* Remove `TestListVpcsWithConfigFile`, replacing with `TestShouldIncludeVpc`. Table based unit tests are more efficient and can easily test several use cases at once.
