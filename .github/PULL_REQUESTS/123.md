# First attempt at cloud-nuking ECS clusters

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Jun 25, 2020*

**Goal of the PR and the task:**
To update the cloud-nuke to delete ECS clusters with "older-than" filtering.

**How this PR will be updated:**
This PR is a **draft** PR at this stage. Please add any comments related to the goal and plans/tasks below as you wish - any feedback is welcome. 

First attempt at nuking ecs-clusters:
- [x] create empty ecs-cluster with `created_at` tag 
- [x] make sure I can tag and retireve tags for ecs cluster 
- [x] select the ecs cluster and if tag is present ~-> nuke~
- [x] get all ECS clusters with tag `first_seen`, or otherwise set it 
- [x] nuke all ECS clusters (from input list of ECS cluster ARNs)

2nd stage - if timestamp provided is before tag (as timestamp value) or after:
- [x] add timestamp to `first_seen` tag 
- [x] update methods to interpret timestamp
- [x] update filtering based on tag to be able to extract `older than input timestamp` ECS clusters

Tasks:
- [x]To re-read & update as makes sense [x] README initial state of change and additional functionality
- [x] Add ecs_cluster.go
- [x] Write tests for ecs_cluster.go
- [x] add a type def for clusters

Hey @ina-stoyanova, 

I was playing around with this locally and ran into an error:

```
Looks like a time parsing / formatting issue.

Some extra context: I created this test ECS cluster in my account a few minutes before running this. I added two tags to my cluster, they were both nonsense keys and true or false values.

Ah interesting - I hit that issue too, just under different circumstances (when I was writing the tests).

I’m curious to see if I can replicate your issue.

The problem for me before was that the RFC3339 format did not understand these +0000 UTC at the end.

The solution I found earlier (also got my tests passing for this issue) was to set the tag as “RFC3339” too & then parse it explicitly in that format too:

time.Parse(time.RFC3339, aws.StringValue(tag.Value))  to retrieve the tag value
time...Format(time.RFC3339) to set the tag in the tests
