Unfortunately the only test I haven't been able to run is `TestNukeEFSVolumeWithMountTargets` since in our test company's accounts we do not have Default VPC and the test just fails.

@GiampaoloFalqui Can you resolve the merge conflicts and address the review comments if this is still a feature you need.  We will be closing stale PRs soon.
