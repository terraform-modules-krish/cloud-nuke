Upgrading to Circle 2 isn't just about renaming the file... The format has changed completely too!

@brikis98, cloud-nuke already used version 2. It was just using the old file/folder structure

Compare https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml with https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-messaging/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml
