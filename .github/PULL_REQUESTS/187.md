# Exclude transit gateway resources from nuking job

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 1, 2021*

There appears to be a bug in the implementation of the transit gateway nuking job that causes our account nuking CI job to fail. See [this failing build](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/3272/workflows/466051ad-35fb-47b4-a5e4-5ba89d1db316/jobs/24002) for example.

Note that it does not appear to be IAM permission related, as the transit gateway related IAM permissions are all nested under `ec2`, which our CI user has full access to.

This PR disables nuking those resources until we can find a resolution.

Thanks for review! Going to merge this in so we can get nuking going again.

Looks like it has to do with the availability of the service within the region:

```
$ aws --region us-west-2 ec2 describe-transit-gateway-vpc-attachments                                                                                                                                
{
    "TransitGatewayVpcAttachments": []
}
$ aws --region ap-northeast-3 ec2 describe-transit-gateway-vpc-attachments                                                                                                        

An error occurred (InvalidAction) when calling the DescribeTransitGatewayVpcAttachments operation: The action DescribeTransitGatewayVpcAttachments is not valid for this web service.
