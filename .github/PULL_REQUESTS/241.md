# Support SecurityHub

**ekristen** commented *Nov 16, 2021*

This implements SecurityHub for cloud-nuke. This has a helper function that makes an API call to determine if SecurityHub is enabled first in each region and skips if it is disabled so that errors do not occur.

@ekristen We're getting caught up on old PRs.  If this is still a feature you need, could you resolve the merge conflicts, add telemetry as exists in other modules, add any relevant tests, and update the readme?

Closing this PR request since we haven't received any response for the past 2 months and the PR has been stale for almost 2 years. Let's re-open this if we need this in the future.
