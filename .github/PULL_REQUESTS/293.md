# Ensure VPCEs are deleted before attempting to delete subnets

**sHesl** commented *Apr 10, 2022*

Fixes #285.

- Moves VPCE deletion to before subnet deletion
- Adds `waitForVPCEndpointsToBeDeleted` to ensure Interface endpoints (which can take a few minutes to delete) are no longer in the 'deleting' state. Without this, the endpoints will be marked for deletion (`state=deleting`), but nuking the subnet immediately after will still fail with the same `DependencyViolation` error. Only when the VPCEs are `state=deleted` will the subnet nuke succeed.

## Testing
Scenario: 1 VPC with 5 VPCEs (x4 Interfaces, x1 gateway)
