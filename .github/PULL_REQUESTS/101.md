# Prepare #96 for merge

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 1, 2020*

This is an extension of #96 to prepare for merging into our environment. Specifically, our accounts are not ready to consider S3 buckets for nuking, but we also don't want to block the PR on our inaction to prep. So this extends the PR with a stopgap solution to exclude `s3` from consideration.

The main commit to look at and review is 15f7288, which introduces the `--exclude-resource-type` CLI arg and updates the circleci config to make use of it.
