> LGTM, except for one thing, I think it would be good to have one or two mocks for what a config yaml file would look like with API Gateway, and a test for that mock.

Thanks for review! I've introduced complete mock tests for configuration with APIGateway v1 and v2 in [695ac8f](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/352/commits/695ac8fd3835b72299fb1917e08c9e6f986663bc)

Double-check if we should release this as a new MINOR. Anytime a new resource type is added we've been releasing a backward incompatible update.

Thanks for reviews! Going to merge this in now.

I'll release it as backward incompatible given https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke#choosing-a-new-release-tag
