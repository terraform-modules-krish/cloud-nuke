# Support GuardDuty

**ekristen** commented *Nov 16, 2021*

I implemented this before I saw there was an existing PR https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/199 open.

Unfortunately the existing one is out of date and hasn't been touched since 27 September. 

- [x] Update Documentation
- [ ] Update Tests
- [x] Update Code

I have 2 other PRs ready to tee up to support AWS Config and SecurityHub as well. I also have the need to implement several others. CloudFormations, VPC (all it's children) and more. 

- Potentially Resolves https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/175

@ekristen thanks for raising this PR! We're currently ramping up someone to help us maintain this repo and we'll get to review this as soon as our maintainer is fully ramped up!

Hello Erik! Following my comment in the AWS Config PR, can you add an automated test that checks that the nuke function works?

Thanks for the initial contribution! We actually had a need for this internally at Gruntwork, so we ended up superseding this work at https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/320
