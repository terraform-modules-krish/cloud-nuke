# Don't log to `STDOUT` when being used as a library

## Description

Obnoxiously, cloud-nuke currently logs to `STDOUT` by default, which interferes with several use-cases. For one, using the library in a Terminal User Interface (TUI) context.

These changes remove the hard-coded log line in the `InspectResources` method, which only accepts a query, and therefore exists squarely in the library usage context.
