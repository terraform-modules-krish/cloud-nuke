# Fix Config file not including when there is a 'exclude' rule

**marinalimeira** commented *Sep 28, 2021*

Fixes #198.

Refactored the function `ShouldInclude` to behave properly when there is a `exclude` but no `include` config. I added a unit test to this function that catches the bug in question.
