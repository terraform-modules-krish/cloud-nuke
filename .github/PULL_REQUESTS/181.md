# Nuke IAM Users

**hposca** commented *Mar 5, 2021*

Closes #160 , Implements #116 

Now we can delete IAM Users, configuring inclusion and exclusion rules on the configuration file and having a clean output when deleting IAM Users (as they are global and not region specific).

Please read each commit message for more details.

All comments are welcomed.

Thank you so much for your thorough review :bowing_man:

@ina-stoyanova @zackproser @yorinasub17 mind taking another look, specially at the [last commit](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/181/commits/01e5d6e8d7d9fe342fa92f2cd69d5deccbe57730)?
This last one is _"only a small feature"_:tm:  that actually requires a bunch of other stuff and extra validations, which I believe I was able to do.
Thanks :smile:

@yorinasub17 mind taking another look into the new commits that implemented the NITs that you gave?
(The retry logic will be in another PR)
