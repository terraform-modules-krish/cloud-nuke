- Adds --region flag to select specific regions.
- Updated README.md

This also improves on the UX by:

1. Calling out the regions in the first log message. 
2. Not mixing ``` Skipping region ``` log message with ```Checking region``` as the user is interested only in the target region.
3. Adding current_n / total_n so that the user is aware of the retrieval progress.


Instead of 

```
go run main.go aws  --exclude-region eu-north-1 --exclude-region ap-south-1 --exclude-region eu-west-1 --exclude-region ap-northeast-2

INFO[2019-09-21T17:10:38+00:00] Skipping region: eu-north-1
INFO[2019-09-21T17:10:38+00:00] Skipping region: ap-south-1
INFO[2019-09-21T17:10:38+00:00] Checking region: eu-west-3
INFO[2019-09-21T17:10:47+00:00] Checking region: eu-west-2                   
INFO[2019-09-21T17:11:00+00:00] Skipping region: eu-west-1                   
INFO[2019-09-21T17:11:00+00:00] Skipping region: ap-northeast-2              
INFO[2019-09-21T17:11:00+00:00] Checking region: ap-northeast-1       
.
.
```

We now have 

```
go run main.go aws  --exclude-region eu-north-1 --exclude-region ap-south-1 --exclude-region eu-west-1 --exclude-region ap-northeast-2                            

INFO[2019-09-21T17:11:23+08:00] Retrieving active AWS resources in [eu-west-3, eu-west-2, ap-northeast-1, sa-east-1, ca-central-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, eu-central-1, us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-1, us-west-2]
INFO[2019-09-21T17:11:23+00:00] Checking region [1/12]: eu-west-3

INFO[2019-09-21T17:11:58+00:00] Checking region [5/12]: ca-central-1         
.
.
.
```

4. Makes ```--region``` and ```--exclude-region``` mutually exclusive.

```
$ go run main.go aws --region us-east-1 --exclude-region us-west-1      
                     
ERRO[2019-09-21T17:59:25+00:00] --region and --exclude-region are mutually exclusive  error="--region and --exclude-region are mutually exclusive"
exit status 1
```
5. Improves function signature of  ```GetAllResources```  from

```
func GetAllResources(regions []string, excludedRegions []string, excludeAfter time.Time, resourceTypes []string) (*AwsAccountResources, error)                      
```

to

```
func GetAllResources(targetRegions []string, excludeAfter time.Time, resourceTypes []string) (*AwsAccountResources, error)                            
```

@Etiene Could you review?
***

**saurabh-hirani** commented *Oct 1, 2019*

@Etiene  with the updated code as per the feedback, when I tested ```aws_test.go```'s test function ```TestGetTargetRegions``` I got the error:

```
~/go/packages/src/github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/aws/mocks/EC2API.go:389:72: undefined: ec2.ApplySecurityGroupsToClientVpnTargetNetworkInput
~go/packages/src/github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/aws/mocks/EC2API.go:389:128: undefined: ec2.ApplySecurityGroupsToClientVpnTargetNetworkOutput
.
.
```

which points to an older version of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/aws/mocks/EC2API.go 
I regenerated the same file by following - https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/aws/ec2_unit_test.go#L7 as 

```
mockgen -source vendor/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/ec2/ec2iface/interface.go -destination aws/mocks/EC2API.go
```

and the tests **worked**. The new ```EC2API.go``` has significant changes from the older ones. I have pasted a diff here - https://gist.github.com/saurabh-hirani/fe8419c08d60fe734952b5a36972194f

Should this be tracked in a separate issue? I didn't want to pollute the existing PR with the same and wanted your advice on it.

@brikis98 @Etiene - can you please check and let me know if this is good to merge?

Sorry for the delay, @saurabh-hirani . I can take a look at this.

**saurabh-hirani** commented *Oct 11, 2019*

Thanks @autero1

**autero1** commented *Oct 11, 2019*

I re-ran the tests with your latest commits and the tests passed. Unfortunately I didn't get to make a final run-through on this PR, but will try and finalize this first thing Monday morning.

Thanks for the review and merge @autero1!

**autero1** commented *Oct 14, 2019*

Still waiting for the tests to pass before I release.
