# Prompt for 'nuke' again on invalid responses

**aqche** commented *Oct 10, 2019*

Here is my take on addressing issue #26. Instead of exiting if the user types in an invalid input to the nuke prompt, the user will be notified that the input was invalid and prompted again. A note that you can exit with ^C is added as well.

Thanks for the PR @aqche !

The change makes sense, will run the test suite now.

Tests passed and the code looks good. Just one remark about documenting the function.

@autero1 I added a comment explaining the reasoning behind multiple tries. Also, I removed the unneeded `else` block just to make things slightly cleaner. Thanks!
