I _believe_ that issue #228 has already been addressed by #230. @ina-stoyanova is that correct? If so, we should close issue #228.

@infraredgirl That's correct! Thanks for catching this! 

@alvarodelvalle Thanks for your contribution here! It's a bit of a confusion, since I assumed this issue would be auto-closed, once the PR I raised & merged was closed. Turns out I forgot to link this issue to the PR ðŸ™„ Sorry for the confusion!

I still had a look at your changes to the Readme and verified that we've got it all in the Readme currently. That was the case indeed, so I'll be closing this PR.
