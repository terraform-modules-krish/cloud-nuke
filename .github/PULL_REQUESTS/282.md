I also had to update run the code-generation for the EC2API mock to run the tests. 
In addition, I slightly update the AWS session creation in aws.go so that it supports sso profiles. Feel free to remove if this is outside of the scope of this PR.

Heads up that I went ahead and resolved the merge conflict for this in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/332 so that it can be merged.
