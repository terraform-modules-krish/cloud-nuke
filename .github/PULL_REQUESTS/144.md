# Nuke gruntwork S3 buckets

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 14, 2020*

This updates the CircleCI config to run nuke jobs for S3 buckets. To avoid deleting buckets that we expect to use, this adds a config file with the regex list that we have been using in the `aws-gc.py` script.

Note that I also updated the nuke jobs to not depend on the tests passing. It seems unnecessary to continuously run tests for every nuke job, especially since they are fairly slow. Not to mention that they are flaky and transiently fail, causing us to skip a nuke cycle.
