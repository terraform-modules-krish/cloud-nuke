> Add a big, huge WARNING here. Yell at the user to tell them this is irreversible! Make the warning red (example of using colors on the CLI here).

The text is printed by the `PromptUserForYesNo` function which defaults to `BRIGHT_GREEN` with no way of specifying a custom color

Sure, but you can add a separate logging statement just before that in red! This is a hugely dangerous tools, so we need to very seriously warn users. In fact, even "yes/no" might not be the right prompt here. We might want to force users to type "nuke" or something where you can't possibly do it by accident.
