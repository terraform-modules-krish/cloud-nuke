Absolutely - there's 3 things todo to get this merged:
1) Build logs & S3 - verify that buckets that get created are also getting deleted
2) check why CircleCI tests failed
3) what do we do with all the rest of the previously left-over buckets on the nuclear-wasteland AWS account? should we just run the nuke command against them @yorinasub17 @brikis98

1. Build logs & S3 - verify that buckets that get created are also getting deleted ‚úÖ
2. Check why CircleCI tests failed ‚ö†Ô∏è - skipped failing test for now (unrelated to s3 code changes) & https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/145 
3. What do we do with all the rest of the previously left-over buckets on the nuclear-wasteland AWS account - üëç run the nuke all  against them
