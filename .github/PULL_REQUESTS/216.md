Merging in so we start nuking our account again!

Why was this not caught in the original PR? Do we need to add a regression test?

We don't have a unit test that sanity checks our own internal circleci nuke config, and the nuke job only runs on trunk. I think adding a regression test that confirms it's parseable makes sense!
