Fixes #236 

Open question: do we want to add support for Elasticache to the config file?

All done @yorinasub17. Qq: do we no longer run the CI tests for every push?

We do, but we heightened the security ACLs on CircleCI such that only certain github users can trigger builds that access the secrets. I think we are still in discussion about whether contractors should have those permissions or not. Until we get that sorted out, we will have to have one of the FTEs trigger the builds.

There's a failure in `TestListElasticacheClustersWithConfigFile`, will look into it tomorrow

Hey @yorinasub17, I've pushed up a fix for the failing test. Please help run the CI again when you get the chance
