hi @ina-stoyanova! Sorry for the long silence. Yes, I do want to get this PR finished and merged. I would like to have a bit of time to jump back into this and get it done. Hopefully I am not blocking anything where you want to make some progress.

Hey @HebertCL no you're not blocking at all! We've been reviewing some stale PRs hence my comment. Take your time and you're welcome to keep working on the PR. Your contribution is very welcome.
