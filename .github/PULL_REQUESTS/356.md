# UI overhaul and per-resource error reporting

## Demo

* [Nuking multiple resource types, mix of success and error outcomes](https://asciinema.org/a/CniiLV21a4QaOQo5tO2ZaLW9o)
* [Nuking multiple resource types successfully](https://asciinema.org/a/CpLvZOXGm2PeTHoty0vg17l02)
## Description

These changes: 
* Implement support for displaying the status of a given cloud-nuke run in a pterm.sh table 
* Attempt to provide a per-resource status that is more accurate, rather than returning `nil` when something in a batch process fails
* Suppress excessive `stdout` logging by replacing all `Infof` calls with `Debugf`, so that the original information can still be retrieved by passing `--log-level DEBUG`
* Implement a spinner that displays `Nuking resources...` for the duration of the cloud-nuke run. On run completion, the spinner is replaced with the table. 

These changes are conceived of as an incremental improvement to the legibility of cloud-nuke's output, and a prerequisite to work that will leverage cloud-nuke to programmatically tear down deployed Reference Architectures.

### Example tables

```
❯ aws-vault exec nuketest -- ./cloud-nuke \
  aws \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --resource-type sqs \
  --resource-type snstopic \
  --resource-type lambda \
  --resource-type elasticache
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-09-06T14:50:16-04:00] The following resource types will be nuked:
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-09-06T14:50:16-04:00] - sqs
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-09-06T14:50:16-04:00] - snstopic
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-09-06T14:50:16-04:00] - lambda
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-09-06T14:50:16-04:00] - elasticache
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-09-06T14:50:17-04:00] Retrieving active AWS resources in [us-east-1]
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-09-06T14:50:18-04:00] The following 2 AWS resources will be nuked:
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-09-06T14:50:18-04:00] * lambda myFunction us-east-1
[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-09-06T14:50:18-04:00] * elasticache test-redis us-east-1

THE NEXT STEPS ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND COMPLETELY IRREVERSIBLE, PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!!

Are you sure you want to nuke all listed resources? Enter 'nuke' to confirm (or exit with ^C): nuke

Nuking complete:

(Note to anyone who is following along. I'll plan to pick this up again when I return to the office. If anyone on the team wants to merge this in the meantime, that's fine, too!)
