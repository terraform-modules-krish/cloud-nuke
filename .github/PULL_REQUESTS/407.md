# Backport UI enhancements to defaults-aws cmd

**zackproser** commented *Feb 3, 2023*

<!-- Prepend '[WIP]' to the title if this PR is still a work-in-progress. Remove it when it is ready for review! -->

## Description

Fixes #399. 

These changes carry through some of the recent UI enhancements that weren't originally flowed through the `defaults-aws` command, for example. In addition, these changes consolidate common UI functionality behind convenience methods. 

<!-- Description of the changes introduced by this PR. -->

## TODOs

Read the [Gruntwork contribution guidelines](https://gruntwork.notion.site/Gruntwork-Coding-Methodology-02fdcd6e4b004e818553684760bf691e).

- [x] Update the docs.
- [x] Run the relevant tests successfully, including pre-commit checks.

- [x] Include release notes. If this PR is backward incompatible, include a migration guide.
- [x] Attention Grunts - if this PR adds support for a new resource, ensure the `nuke_sandbox` and `nuke_phxdevops` jobs in `.circleci/config.yml` have been updated with appropriate exclusions (either directly in the job or via the `.circleci/nuke_config.yml` file) to prevent nuking IAM roles, groups, resources, etc that are important for the test accounts.


## Release Notes (draft)

<!-- One-line description of the PR that can be included in the final release notes. -->
Add status report to the `defaults-aws` command. Fix several UI issues that were preventing resource deletion status from being displayed correctly. 

### Migration Guide

<!-- Important: If you made any backward incompatible changes, then you must write a migration guide! -->

Great catch! Thanks for testing. I've reverted the change I made that was causing default security groups not to be targeted correctly. 

However, from my testing, it seems the removal of default security groups doesn't work, and this document suggests that's because you can't delete default security groups: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/default-custom-security-groups.html

So perhaps deleting the default vpc works, but deleting only the default security groups doesn't, but it's also odd that we're not getting back an error when cloud-nuke claims to have deleted the default security groups successfully.

Great! I will test it again.

What really happens (and it's super useful for CIS compliance), is that it deletes the Security Group ingress/egress rules. The SG are still there, but useless.

Good observation, it finds the `Default rules for SG`, but in the summary it shows `Default Security Group`. 
Maybe because it finds the SG every time, when I re-run cloud-nuke, it shows as an existing resource.

I ran `aws ec2-describe-security-groups --region us-west-2`, and I get this output below. The group is there but it's empty, which is the desired effect! The result of running cloud-nuke again should be something like "Default SG exists but has no ingress/egress rules, so nothing to do". Running it twice, I got the same output above.

It's very likely that this is an old bug. We can mark this one as fixed given the original error is not happenin, and we can report a new one. What do you think?
