# Add feature to delete RDS instances

**marinalimeira** commented *Jan 7, 2020*

Following #84.

From the first part:
- [X] Create a new RDS instance
- [X] The lookup for the instances based on region
- [X] Nuke the instance based on the lookup results (with SkipFinalSnapshot: true)
- [x] Run from CLI
- [x] Delete RDS remaining instances on AWS 
- [x] Add the RDS to be searchable by the --resource-type flag.
- [x] Get instances by age (older than xx)

Thank you for the review @yorinasub17 ! I push the simpler issues and I'll finish the others later, there are still a few improvements for this to be working from the cli.

@marinalimeira Could you go through the existing comments on the PR and respond to / resolve them as appropriate? And update the TODO list in the README description? That will make follow-up review rounds easier.
