# Rewrite first pass [DO NOT MERGE]

**bboughton** commented *Nov 17, 2017*

Here is my first pass at rewriting this tool in Go. I have separated the work into multiple commits for easier review. The most interesting commit is 05b3710.

### Notes

* I focused mainly on getting the first task of deleting all EC2 instances completed. I have not taken the time to clean up the code, refactor, or add comments. I have attempted to add comments to the main areas that need to be cleaned up. Please feel free to ask about specific sections you have questions on and I will elaborate as to thinking.

* My general approach was to not try to prematurely optimize, so the code strictly focuses on Listing and Destroying EC2 instances. My thinking is that the code will be refactored as other resources are added to make it more general.

* I was able to get an integration test working, but didn't implement any unit test for this first pass.
