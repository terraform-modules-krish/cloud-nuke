# Improvements to defaults-aws command

**bwhaley** commented *Dec 7, 2019*

This PR addresses #80 and #81:

- Adds the `--sg-only` flag to limit the command to only remove default security group rules and not delete default VPCs
- Adds the ability to include/exclude specific regions

This was trivial to add as the regions feature was already available in the `aws` subcommand, including tests.
