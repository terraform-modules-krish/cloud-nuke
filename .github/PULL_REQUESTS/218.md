Why not trigger test run on the original PR?

To be honest - I forgot if that's possible and how to. It gave me a PR number, so I just went with what it said on the Readme. Any pointers?

And also I believe there's actually the limiter that we've got a PR that's been raised from someone as an external contributor, so the tests won't be triggered automatically for that PR.
