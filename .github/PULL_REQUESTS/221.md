# Update circle ci build image

These changes attempt to stabilize the cloud-nuke build by switching to a more current tag for the Docker build image, which has resolved issues around 32 bit builds, etc.

> LGTM! I just kicked off a test release to make sure the binary build and deploy works. Once that passes, we can merge this in! https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha.1

Beautiful - thanks!
