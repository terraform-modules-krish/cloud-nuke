LGTM as well! I'll kick off a sanity check regression build now and if that passes, we can merge this in! Thanks for your contribution!

Ah looks like there is a conflict after merging in dynamodb :(

I also see a potential conflict wiht the `ecs` branch as well. Perhaps you should combine the two PRs together so we can merge it in one go?

Opened #266 as a combined PR to resolve merge conflicts.
