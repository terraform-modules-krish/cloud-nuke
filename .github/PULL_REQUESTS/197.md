# Nuke NAT Gateways

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 25, 2021*

This adds support for nuking NAT gateways. Additionally, this introduces a config file that is compatible with our environments (so we don't accidentally delete real NAT resources).

Note that this required bumping the AWS SDK for Go, which in turn required regenerating the EC2 mocks.

Thanks for review! Test failure is an unrelated function that appears to be transient, so I'll go ahead and merge this in!
