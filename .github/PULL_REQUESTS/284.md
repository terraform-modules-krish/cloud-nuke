Looks like there is a legitimate build failure:

```
# github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/config [github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/config.test]
./config_test.go:30:15: too few values in Config{...}
FAIL    github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/config [build failed]
FAIL
```

Can you look into fixing that? Thanks!
