# Exclude VPC from periodic nuking

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 17, 2021*

When we merged in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/243, we started nuking VPCs in our accounts. Normally this isn't a problem, but there are two issues with this that make it disruptive to our test flow:

- The VPC feature doesn't honor the `--older-than` parameter, so it will start nuking all VPCs regardless of when they were created. This is disruptive to our tests as it can start nuking a VPC that is being used in testing.

- The VPC feature doesn't honor the config file, so we can't exclude certain VPCs. We have a VPC in our sandbox test account that we use for demos that we don't want nuked, and currently there isn't a way to exclude that from nuking consideration.

This PR updates our periodic nuking routine so that it excludes the VPCs for now, until we implement the above two features.
