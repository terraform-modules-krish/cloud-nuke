# Attempt to stabilize build

- Remove exclusion for transit gateway. Not sure why we had some exclusions there for our nuke jobs, since we don't use transit gateway internally.
- Add logging to find the regions where the RDS cluster test fails (I had a few builds where it failed, but couldn't discern the region).
