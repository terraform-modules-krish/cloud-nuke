# Update to latest CircleCi image; don't require tests to pass when building binaries

**brikis98** commented *Apr 15, 2021*

This should pick up the latest versions of Go and the `build-go-binaries` script, which should build binaries for Darwin ARM 64. Hopefully, this fixes #190.

I've also updated the build to not require the tests to pass on release builds when publishing binaries.

Gah, until https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/188 is merged, our Transit Gateway tests are failing intermittently. I've also updated this PR to no longer require tests to pass to build a binary.

OK, new binaries, including ARM ones, are in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/releases/tag/v0.0.0-internal-test.
