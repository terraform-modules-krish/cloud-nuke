# Improve nuking strategy

**tonerdo** commented *Oct 4, 2018*

Currently when iterating over resource IDs and nuking each, cloud-nuke returns from the function when it encounters an error. This results in the other resources further down the list not being deleted on that pass.

This PR updates cloud-nuke to log when it encounters an error and continue with other resources in the list. This should greatly reduce the amount of leftover resources we see and should slightly reduce our monthly costs
