# GovCloud compatibility

**bwhaley** commented *Jan 26, 2021*

This fixes the region finder logic to work with GovCloud. AFAICT, the rest of the functionality is compatible with GovCloud already. This was tested out by a customer. See [relevant slack thread](https://gruntwork-io.slack.com/archives/CLDULACTZ/p1611694482002400).

Thanks for the review. The test failed. I believe the failure is unrelated to this change, but I'm going to run the tests again here.

Tests are passing, so I'll merge this update.
