## Description

Dependency of: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/refarch-deployer/pull/17

These changes implement support for optionally passing in an `aws.Config` object when scripting with `cloud-nuke`. This will support additional use cases, including our own, of running cloud-nuke in preflight checks against multiple accounts in a loop.

Thanks for reviews! Looks like the test failures were unrelated to these changes: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/7833/workflows/81543747-df55-47c6-928a-340ad4b6cf7c/jobs/28751

So, I'm going to merge this in now.
