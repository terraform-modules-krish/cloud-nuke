**saurabh-hirani** commented *Nov 10, 2019*

- Adds --dry-run flag to to exit after listing resources to nuke but before taking action.
- Fixing code bug where if no resources found cloud-nuke prompts user to nuke an empty list of resources.

1. Dry run demo:

-  Added by https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/78/commits/87e6aa3a7d662805ab86db91408bd01491e64032

- Before:

```
go run main.go aws --region us-west-2 

INFO[2019-11-10T18:04:04+08:00] Retrieving active AWS resources in [us-west-2]
INFO[2019-11-10T18:04:04+08:00] Checking region [1/1]: us-west-2
INFO[2019-11-10T18:04:16+08:00] The following AWS resources are going to be nuked:

THE NEXT STEPS ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND COMPLETELY IRREVERSIBLE, PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!!

Are you sure you want to nuke all listed resources? Enter 'nuke' to confirm (or exit with ^C):
```

- After:

```
go run main.go aws --region us-west-2 --dry-run

2. Nuking empty resource list bug fix.

- Fixed by https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/78/commits/bf0c567ddab7caf8f574961a45d83732ded131e9

- Assumption: no resources present in eu-north-1

- Before:

```
go run main.go aws --region eu-north-1

INFO[2019-11-10T17:48:35+08:00] Retrieving active AWS resources in [eu-north-1] 
INFO[2019-11-10T17:48:35+08:00] Checking region [1/1]: eu-north-1            
INFO[2019-11-10T17:48:37+08:00] The following AWS resources are going to be nuked:  

THE NEXT STEPS ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND COMPLETELY IRREVERSIBLE, PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!!

Are you sure you want to nuke all listed resources? Enter 'nuke' to confirm (or exit with ^C):
```

Note that cloud-nuke is showing the nuke message even though there are no resources present which is confusing to the user. 

- After:

```
go run main.go aws --region eu-north-1

INFO[2019-11-10T18:01:37+08:00] Retrieving active AWS resources in [eu-north-1]
INFO[2019-11-10T18:01:37+08:00] Checking region [1/1]: eu-north-1
INFO[2019-11-10T18:01:45+08:00] Nothing to nuke, you're all good!

```

This is because the ```account.Resources``` is updated with list of empty lists or maps from the ```aws.GetAllResources``` code i.e. in the **before** state its value is:

```
map[eu-north-1:{[{[]} {[]} {[]} {[]} {[]} {[]} {[]} {[]} {[]} {[] map[]} {[]}]}]
```

which has individual resources returned as empty but a list of empty lists isn't empty. Updated code to handle this situation.

@autero1 Could you review?

Thanks for the PR @saurabh-hirani !  

The PR looks good, you should just add documentation about the `--dry-run` flag in the README.

I'll kick off the tests now.
