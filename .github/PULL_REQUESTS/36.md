# Nuke ECS services and ECS clusters

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 11, 2018*

First attempt at addressing https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/32

This implements nuking of:
- ECS tasks (indirectly, by draining ECS services)
- ECS services
- ~ECS clusters~

This does NOT implement nuking of:
- ECS task definitions
- Target groups for LB
- Service discovery services and namespaces

- Removed ECS cluster deleting and added notes on why to README
- Refactored nukeAllEcsServices

@brikis98 Is it ok to merge this? I have taken out ECS cluster deleting as requested. This now only contains deleting ECS services, which does have a timestamp we can use.
