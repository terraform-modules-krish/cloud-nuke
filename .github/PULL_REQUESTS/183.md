# Implement retry logic

**hposca** commented *Mar 16, 2021*

This is based on the [recommendation made by Yori](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/181#discussion_r594453058)

Currently this is useful when we are trying to delete a login profile that has been created recently, but can be used on other parts too.

~Based on what we have [on terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/blob/master/modules/retry/retry.go). And adapted the tests to what we have here.~
Using [current latest `go-commons` release](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons/releases/tag/v0.8.2) to implement the retry logic

~NOTE: Depends on #181~

~Also, by [scout rule](https://www.matheus.ro/2017/12/11/clean-code-boy-scout-rule/), I removed the last dependency for `terratest` on the code.~ -> Remove `terratest` dependencies will appear in another PR, maybe

To update the code to use the newest version of `go-commons` I ended up doing a bit more than I was expecting and want some feedback to check if this process is expected as this ended up being more a golang discovery journey...

To use `go-commons` I had to do a `go get github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons`, which then updated `go.mod` and `go.sum` to use newer versions of some packages, specially the `aws-sdk-go` from `v1.22.3` to `v1.34.27`. This [broke the tests](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/3123/workflows/51c965ff-1b07-4f7f-ab3e-540f4a165114/jobs/23768) because the underlying API on the SDK changed, which broke the Mocks. Then I had to run `mockgen` to update `mocks/EC2API.go` and then the tests went green.

❓Is this normal in the Golang world?❓

- There is no problem in the "to use this library you need to update other libraries" situation but at the same time,
- It doesn't feel right to be force-pushed to use a newer version of a super important library as the `aws-sdk`
  - In my mind this entire forced update to use the newest `aws-sdk` doesn't make too much sense as [`go-commons`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons/blob/master/go.mod) doesn't even use `aws-sdk-go` 🤔
  - Googling for "how to update a single package" and similar queries didn't return anything useful (It seems that this is the expected golang behaviour)
    - From the Ruby world, updating a gem usually updates only the directly required gems

Oof, that is painful. I have not personally had issues where a particular version of a dependent package ended up causing issues, but have had lots of issues with `goimports -w` which I run on save and go modules fighting each other especially when there's a been a hard fork of a particular package as was the case with `go-git`(https://github.com/go-git/go-git#project-status) which was super fun resolve - as all the structs and methods were identical - so `goimports` kept swapping in the wrong one. 

I'm not sure if this answer on pinning particular modules https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53682247/how-to-point-go-module-dependency-in-go-mod-to-a-latest-commit-in-a-repo would have helped you in this case - that being said, if you were able to update the mocks and ended up upgrading to a newer package version :man_shrugging: In other instances, `go mod tidy` [can sometimes be of assistance](https://golangbyexample.com/go-mod-tidy/)

@brikis98 @bwhaley and @yorinasub17 will have more insight into the particulars of these tests.

I've seen this kind of issue before when updating go lang modules. When you have transitive dependencies which change, i.e., your repo depends on -> A which depends on -> B, and B has changed. See [the blocker in terragrunt for updating terraform to 0.14 internally](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1505).

I was finally able to understand why those things happened 😄

First, thank you all for the comments and links they were the starting point for the discovery 😄

TL;DR: It seems that this is expected as `github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons@v0.8.2` depends on `github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10` which depends on `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27`

**TL version**

Spiralling through Google I found out [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63074019) that pointed out the existence of `go mod graph` which prints the module requirement graph (for each line: before the whitespace is the module and after it is one of its dependencies). So by doing a reverse search, beginning with `aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27`:

```
go mod graph | grep aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27

github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27
github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27 golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20200202094626-16171245cfb2
github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27 github.com/pkg/errors@v0.9.1
github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27 github.com/jmespath/go-jmespath@v0.3.0
github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27 github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql@v1.5.0
```

Looking at the `github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27` line it says that `kubergrunt` depends on this `aws-sdk-go` version... Then, trying to find who depends on `kubergrunt`:

```
go mod graph | grep github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10

github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 sigs.k8s.io/aws-iam-authenticator@v0.5.1
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 k8s.io/client-go@v0.18.3
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 k8s.io/apimachinery@v0.18.3
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 k8s.io/api@v0.18.3
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/urfave/cli@v1.22.4
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/stretchr/testify@v1.6.1
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/sirupsen/logrus@v1.6.0
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/mitchellh/go-homedir@v1.1.0
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest@v0.30.0
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-cli@v0.7.0
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/blang/semver/v4@v4.0.0
github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10 github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27
github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons@v0.8.2 github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10
```

This line `github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons@v0.8.2 github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10` tells that it is required by `go-commons` 😄

So, in summary, `github.com/gruntwork-io/go-commons@v0.8.2` depends on `github.com/gruntwork-io/kubergrunt@v0.6.10` which depends on `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go@v1.34.27` which then caused this required update 😄

I also found on the [go mod documentation](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#why-does-go-mod-tidy-record-indirect-and-test-dependencies-in-my-gomod) that there is the `go mod why` command but it wasn't helpful 😞

Nice spelunking, and thanks for sharing the results of your investigation!
