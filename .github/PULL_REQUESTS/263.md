OK, I re-ran the tests a bunch of times, but I'm getting different intermittent failures each time. @denis256 Could you:

1. Take a look at [the list of failures](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/227#issuecomment-1010973474).
2. Use your best judgment to decide if they are related to this PR (I'm guessing not).
3. If they are unrelated, please merge & release this PR, and dig into https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/227 to see if we can stabilize the tests a bit.

Thanks!

Failing tests seems to be unrelated with lambda functions changes, will continue stabilization work in #227
