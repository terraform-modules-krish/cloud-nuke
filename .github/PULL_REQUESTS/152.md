# Fix CircleCI Contexts

**zackproser** commented *Nov 19, 2020*

This pull request was programmatically opened by the multi-repo-updater program. It should be adding the 'Gruntwork Admin' context to any Workflows -> Jobs nodes and should also be leaving the rest of the .circleci/config.yml file alone. 

 This PR was opened so that all our repositories' .circleci/config.yml files can be converted to use the same CircleCI context, which will make rotating secrets much easier in the future.

Thanks @brikis98 - do we need to coordinate on this timing to avoid any failures, issues?

I think it'll work fine to merge this... When, later, I go through and remove the env vars from each project, I'll need too remember to update Gruntwork Admin context accordingly.
