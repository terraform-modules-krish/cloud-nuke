# Add support for deleting Auto Scaling Groups.

**josh-padnick** commented *Jan 11, 2018*

Note that an ASG cannot be deleted until it contains 0 instances, so we first set the desired capacity down to 0, then wait, then delete the ASG.

Also fixed a bug where we were attempting to terminate EC2 Instances that were already terminated.

We've moved to Go, and this functionality is now part of #5, so closing.
