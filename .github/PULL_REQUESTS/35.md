# Nuke Launch Configurations

**tonerdo** commented *Oct 5, 2018*

This PR adds the ability to nuke launch configurations so we no longer run into our 200 limit.

This brings to light another interesting use case for cloud-nuke. We can consider nuking resources that have quantity limits on them so automated tests don't fail because we hit the limit
