# Fix circleci pipeline to use scheduled pipelines

<!-- Prepend '[WIP]' to the title if this PR is still a work-in-progress. Remove it when it is ready for review! -->

## Description

It turns out that we haven't been running the nuking routines due to the CircleCI triggers changing it's permissions model to no longer support scheduled workflows. Instead, we need to migrate to using [scheduled pipelines](https://circleci.com/docs/scheduled-pipelines). This PR updates the CCI config to start supporting scheduled pipelines.

> We won't know if the config works until the schedule tries to run.

Yup unfortunately, but I think we can iterate on it quickly once Jim creates the initial workflow triggers.

Thanks for review! Will hold off on merging until I confirm the workflow triggers are created on the Project settings.
