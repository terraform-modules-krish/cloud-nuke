@rhoboat these expressions are the patterns in the bucket naming that I saw in the phx-ops account. A sample of the buckets:
```
62svtp-service-test-s3-bucket
6fpzk2-service-test-s3-bucket
6ktc9w-ecs-service-test-s3-bucket
7elhpd-service-test-s3-bucket
7nh7rv-ecs-service-test-s3-bucket
7utrrm-service-test-s3-bucket
80hwrs-service-test-s3-bucket
8f667j-service-test-s3-bucket
```

The way to standardize I think is by updating the test cases that create them.

Thank you for the review! The test case failing is not related to this PR (TestDeleteFullIamUser).
