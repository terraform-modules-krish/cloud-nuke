# Support Nuking CloudFormation StackSets and Stacks

**ekristen** commented *Nov 17, 2021*

This implements the removal of StackSets and Stacks with wait groups to ensure that the status moves to DELETED before considering the item nuked.

**Note:** there is a chance that when targeting stacks only that if it's part of a StackSet it could trigger an error which will be logged.

I'm working on docs and tests. Also found an issue when stacks depend on each other if not deleted in the correct way the current implementation won't work, working on a fix.

It looks like to delete properly each stack's output has to be queried for import use, then a dependency graph built and deleted in order.

@ekristen thanks for your contribution, is this still something you plan on working on? We're in the process of cleaning old PRs and will be closing this in the coming weeks if not.
