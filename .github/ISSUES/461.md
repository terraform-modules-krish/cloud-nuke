Is it possible to nuke resources in the same way as it if we use as library in golang code

Hi, yes, the readme provides instructions:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke#using-cloud-nuke-as-a-library

You can also find API documentation:
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke
