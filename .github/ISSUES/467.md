# Cloud-Nuke does not delete multiple CloudWatch Composite Alarms propperly

**chmcclain** commented *May 30, 2023*

According to the [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteAlarms.html#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20you%20could%20delete%2099%20metric%20alarms%20and%20one%20composite%20alarms%20with%20one%20operation%2C%20but%20you%20can%27t%20delete%20two%20composite%20alarms%20with%20one%20operation.) documentation a program can not delete more than one composite alarm per api call. The [nukeAllCloudWatchAlarms code](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/aws/cloudwatch_alarm.go#L75) does not split multiple composite alarms into multiple API calls.
