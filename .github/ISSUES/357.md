# Improve legibility with table report 

**zackproser** commented *Sep 6, 2022*

It can be difficult to understand what actually happened in a given cloud-nuke run because: 
1. We log everything to `stdout` which quickly becomes difficult to scan for non-trivial jobs
2. cloud-nuke occasionally returns `nil` for an error state even if the resource failed to be deleted successfully. We should try to clean these cases up by ensuring that an error returned during deletion is reflected in the final table
