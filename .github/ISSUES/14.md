# aws-nuke should pause when the --force flag is enabled

**brikis98** commented *Feb 22, 2018*

To give users a chance to hit `CTRL+C` in case of error, aws-nuke should pause for 10 seconds with the log output "Pausing for 10 seconds to give you a last chance to hit CTRL+C" whenever the `--force` flag is enabled.
