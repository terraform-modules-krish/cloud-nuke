Seems like API Gateway V2 (HTTP APIs) are not available in all regions. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-http-apis-for-amazon-api-gateway/#:~:text=The%20API%20V1%20namespace%20represents,via%20the%20AWS%20Management%20Console.

Will limit this test to `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, and `us-west-1` for now.
