# Tag filtering 

**gastrodon** commented *Jan 1, 2021*

I notice that the only resource that can be preserved with tagging are s3 buckets. Would it be acceptable to patch this tool such that every resource may be deleted / preserved based on some tag's presence, for example a tag `cloud-nuke-excluded` and / or `cloud-nuke-included` to have exclusive / inclusive deleting?

Yes please! [As specified in the docs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke#config-file), the config file format, which can do tag filtering, is a relatively recent addition, and we only added support so far for S3. However, we'd love to have it supported for all resources, so a PR to do that is very welcome!

It seems like this issue has been solved by https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke#config-file and the ability to exclude & include a few more resources. 

This is not a very actionable issue, so considering closing it. @infraredgirl @marinalimeira thoughts?

The config file doesn't support tag based filtering yet (see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke#whats-supported), so this issue should still be open.

Just wanted to bring it up, it'd be super helpful to have tag based filtering i.e. cloud-nuke-excluded and cloud-nuke-included so we don't have to mess with or rely on the name of the resource.

Hey, same here! 

We would love to have this feature added. Being able to destroy all ressources that does not have one specific tag or have `cloud-nuke-excluded` tag would be such a great feature.

This tool could be the perfect tool to manage developer sandbox at scale.

+1 for being able to focus on a tag.   This is particularly helpful when you want to target a terragrunt-based service deployment as opposed to all the resources in the region.
