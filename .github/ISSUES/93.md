# Support deleting Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)

Please consider supporting deleting MSK clusters when nuking a region. An MSK cluster does have a tag attribute so it could be filtered out if needed.

We are not currently using MSK, so we're not likely to get to this, but PRs to add support are very welcome!

MSK cluster resource has been added in the past. Will close this issue.
