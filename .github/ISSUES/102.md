# String could not find any enabled regions

**interrupted** commented *Apr 2, 2020*

Hi,
I try to run cloud-nuke aws --resource-type ec2 --dry-run.
I have configured env variables:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION.
I do not have aws cli installed.

When running I get the error message:
*errors.errorString could not find any enabled regions

I tried to follow https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/49
but I can't get the repo mentioned.
Could any one help me with this?
Thanks, Agata

Hi @interrupted,

As per the discussion in the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/49 - can you try the following:

1. Install aws cli and ensure that aws cli is working before using cloud nuke - just to verify that you don't have any aws cli related issues. Doing a simple `aws s3 ls` will help you check any buckets in your account  or `aws ec2 describe-instances` to list instances.

2. If the binary is not working - can you follow instructions in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/77 and see if setting up local dev env works? 

There is no clear way to reproduce the issue you are facing as the previous user who faced the issue got a workaround by using the local dev env mentioned in step 2. Having a docker image with a pre-built `cloud-nuke` and trying it out might isolate the issue to see if it is tied to your machine setup.

Hi,
I tried again with exported variables and it worked without AWS CLI both from linux local machine and pipeline also - it must have been my misconfiguration - thanks anyway for the support.
