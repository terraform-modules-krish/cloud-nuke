# Add support for more complex matching rules

**brikis98** commented *Apr 9, 2020*

We have many clean-up use cases where we want to nuke all resources that match a specific pattern: e.g., nuke S3 buckets, IAM roles, and IAM profiles where the name matches one of a long list of specific regular expressions (i.e., those that come from our automated tests).

We should extend cloud-nuke with a way to filter resources using these match rules. Specifying them via CLI arguments is likely going to be inconvenient, so we may need some config format for this.

I totally agree this would be valuable. 

Related issue (not started): #88 

From that thread, we did land on a general approach of either tag-based or name-based deletions - preferring to use names because tags are not supported by all objects. We had not considered regex patterns for names because my own use case is one whereby all deployments use a standard name-prefix, but in theory at least both could be met by the same solution.

The first version of this is merged: #113 **Add config option for complex matching against s3 buckets**

@brikis98 was this addressed when adding the config file? Can we close this one?

Yup, closing.
