# Feature Request: protect resources from deletion based on a tag

**kjhosein** commented *Nov 14, 2018*

_Example use case:_
Let's say you have a sandbox/dev account and want to use `cloud-nuke` to keep it clean of old artifacts, but on the other hand have resources that you're actively using and that may also be even older than your time threshold. 

_Solution:_ 
Tag those resources with something like `'cloud-nuke'='protect'`
<br />

Yea, we'd love to support:

1. A whitelist of tags to destroy (only destroy resources with the specified tags)
1. A blacklist of tags not to destroy (destroy anything that doesn't have the specified tags)

PRs welcome 😁 

FWIW, cloud-nuke does respected the "protected" flag on EC2 Instances already...

I envision us allowing the user to specify tags via a CLI flag instead of defaulting to a single one
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 14, 2018*

Yes, exactly; the whitelist and blacklist of tags I mentioned above would be passed in as CLI args.

@brikis98,

I'd be happy to work on this, as it's something that would be really useful and I have a bit of spare time.

A couple of questions though:
Should we have a separate method to nuke included/excluded tagged resources rather than using the existing one?
What sorts of tests would you want for this? I know you are running builds using circle CI so wonder what you do about creating/tearing down resources.

Not sure I follow what you're referring to by "method." Do you mean a separate top-level CLI command? Or separate Go method? 

> What sorts of tests would you want for this? I know you are running builds using circle CI so wonder what you do about creating/tearing down resources.

Probably a test that launches a few resources, some with tags, some without, and makes sure cloud-nuke with various tag parameters cleans up the right ones.

I mean a separate go method for nuking tagged resources.

I'd be tempted to say it makes sense to update the existing methods to take tags into account as well, as it should be possible to specify tags *and* other params (e.g., creation date).

I agree, let me get a PR done in the next few days.

Has there been any progress on this (also in regards to the abovementioned PR)? I'd love to see the tag whitelist.

Nothing has happened currently, I am in the process of a big house move, but will get to this when settled.

Not as yet, but there will be after Christmas.
I now have some time and need it for a project.
Thanks,

I started a PR which would allow inclusion and exclusion by a tag.
