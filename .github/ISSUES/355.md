# Support inspecting and nuking Lambda versions

**zackproser** commented *Aug 31, 2022*

There are [List](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_ListLayerVersions.html) and [Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_DeleteLayerVersion.html) methods for Lambda versions. 

It's easy to end up with many stale Lambda versions in your account if you're leveraging the service, so we should consider providing an easy means to finding and nuking those versions.
