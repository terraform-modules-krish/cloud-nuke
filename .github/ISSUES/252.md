# VPC endpoints prevent VPCs from being nuked

**vytautaskubilius** commented *Nov 22, 2021*

It looks like VPC endpoints might be preventing VPCs from being nuked. If I try to nuke a VPC, I encounter the following error:

```
[cloud-nuke] time="2021-11-22T13:16:57Z" level=info msg="Nuking VPC vpc-xxx in region us-east-1"
[cloud-nuke] time="2021-11-22T13:16:57Z" level=info msg="...no Internet Gateway found"

```

If I try to delete the same VPC through the AWS Console, the only resources the delete tool lists to be deleted alongside the VPC are some VPC endpoints. They get deleted without issues when going through the process in the console.

Hi @vytautaskubilius, I looked into this and was unable to repro this issue. I created the VPC with an endpoint and was able to delete it just fine. Did this issue happen consistently?

Hi! It does indeed happen consistently, and I can reproduce it in multiple AWS accounts. I just tested it again with v0.7.3 of cloud-nuke (latest release at the time I'm writing this), and I'm still getting the same error that I provided in the original description. I created a brand new fresh account to test this, and I follow the steps below to reproduce the issue:

1. Create a brand new AWS account in my AWS organization.
2. Create a new VPC with all default settings.
3. Create a VPC endpoint - I pick the S3 `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3` Gateway endpoint.
4. Run cloud-nuke with no extra parameters.
5. Observe the output provided below.

If I try to delete the VPC using the AWS Console, I can see that the endpoint is the only resource there, and I can delete it without any issues:

Let me know if I can provide any more information!

@vytautaskubilius thanks for providing more detailed repro steps. I've now been able to successfully reproduce the problem (I was creating the Endpoint as an "Interface" instead of a "Gateway"). I'll prioritize getting a fix for this out.
