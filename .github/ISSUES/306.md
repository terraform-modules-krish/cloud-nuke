# How to Delete by account 

**mdemarco1234** commented *Jun 3, 2022*

I did not see an option to delete by an account name.  Are resources deleted in the account logged into or can you Delete from another account. We have an audit account and want to specify which account to delete resources from. can this be done? If so how?

Hi,
removal of `IAMUsers` is documented in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/README.md#example 

Not sure if removal of other accounts is supported
