# cloud-output to stdout or a file?

**natemarks** commented *Oct 4, 2023*

cloud-nuke output seems to get lost on some pipeline interfaces. is it possible to just dump the dry-run output of the resources that would be deleted to something without fancy graphics?

I agree, having a no-graphics option would be nice. For me it looks fine on some dashboards, but Kubernetes, for instance doesn't render the emojis correctly

In my use case I use cloud-nuke as a library, and it leads to very ugly logs around my logs. I would prefer having the option of removing the extra logs from the pipeline interface and having a report of what has been done.

I've tried some stuff in my fork but it did not come up with a satisfying solution, which does not either add a breaking change or needs a lot of work

- [sending all pipeline to stderr](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/compare/master...dixneuf19:cloud-nuke:feat-progress-bar-stderr), and then trying to send stdout and stderr at different places (`go run main.go >output.log 2>error.log`). Not very easy to use in a container later
- [Remove the progress-bar altogether](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/compare/master...dixneuf19:cloud-nuke:fix-no-bar), optionnaly. It does not remove all the weird stuff but a good chunk of it. But it breaks a public function.

Anyway, would love to head contributors about this topic, since I am not sure this kind of changes fits with their roadmap
