# cloud-nuke rate exceeded errors

Noticed that `cloud-nuke` periodically fails on removal of IAM Roles
```
...

Wonder if we should consider implementing similar functionality here that [we put into git-xargs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/git-xargs/pull/67/files) to address the same problem, but with GitHub's API. 

There might be a simpler way / package, too.

AWS isn't terribly straightforward about their rate limiting. Basically, they say "you can investigate to find out which calls are being rate limited"
