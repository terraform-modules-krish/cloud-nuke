# Cloud-nuke should leave you with a 100% fresh account.

**josh-padnick** commented *Oct 23, 2019*

We recently received the following customer request:

> So, I wanted a quick destruction of the environment created by terraform. cloud-nuke is great, but it leaves a lot of resources like rds, elastic ips, vpcs, buckets. sqs etc. I'd like to just go back to a state as if it was a fresh account.

> For example I get a warning that elastic ips can't be deleted because they're attached somewhere. Specifically network interface which is not deleted by cloud nuke.

This is more of a meta-issue because updating cloud-nuke to actually get you to a 100% fresh account would mean having support for every available AWS resource, which is an aspirational goal but one that would be very difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, I wanted to record the feedback here so we have it written down.

We plan to address this by gradually adding support to different resources. Closing this since it's not particularly actionable.
