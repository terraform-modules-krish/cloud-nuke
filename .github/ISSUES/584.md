# DependencyViolation Deleting VPC

**hongil0316** commented *Sep 10, 2023*

Quite a lot of errors when deleting VPC resource type. E.g., 

* DependencyViolation: The vpc 'vpc-0880a5bccc135fa5f' has dependencies and cannot be deleted.	
* status code: 400, request id: d24616cf-fc3e-4ed0-9380-595d88b06338 

It seems like there's quite a lot of resources that are dependent or linked to VPC before nuking VPC: 
* Route Tables
* Subnets
* Peering Connections
* VPC Endpoints
* Network ACLs
* Security Groups

Note: it seems like phx_devops cloud-nuke operation seems to fail nuking VPC resource types quite a lot as well - https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/12109/workflows/194dd219-8c8a-45b7-981f-17df28488378/jobs/33851.

The order of operation is quite important when deleting EC2 VPC. Need quite a lot of trial & error to figure out the perfect order because there seem to be quite a lot of dependency violation errors. 

First operations we can do it nuking DHCP options.
