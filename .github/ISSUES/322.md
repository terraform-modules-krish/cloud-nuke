# Feaure: Add support for Macie member accounts

**zackproser** commented *Jul 6, 2022*

Implement support for running cloud-nuke against Macie member accounts, thereby deleting the associations and disabling Macie in the given region. 

Note that we may want to add support for cleaning up resources from the Organizations membership side of things separately. Member accounts seem to be able to disassociate from their admin accounts and disable Macie in their own regions whenever they wish.

I believe this has broken govcloud support for the tool. Once I upgraded I could no longer run the tool in govcloud, I got this error:
```[cloud-nuke] INFO[2022-08-04T17:37:57-04:00] Retrieving active AWS resources in [us-gov-west-1]
