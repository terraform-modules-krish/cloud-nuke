Hey @abhishekmahajan0709222, just to make sure I understand the issue correctly. When you run 

```
cloud-nuke aws
```

It tries to delete your Elasticcache Subnet Group? It didn't show any confirmation prompt before proceeding the deletion? 

The expected behaviour is the following
> Simply running cloud-nuke aws will start the process of cleaning up your cloud account. You'll be shown a list of resources that'll be deleted as well as a prompt to confirm before any deletion actually takes place.

@hongil0316 The issue we have is cloud nuke tries to delete default value of Elasticache subnet group, that results in failure

Is there any way to exclude default resource for deletion?

If yes can you please share the doc link ?
