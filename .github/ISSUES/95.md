Would be nice to be able to delete cloudformation stacks older than x days

Seems like a reasonable feature request, but we don't make much use of CloudFormation here, so we're not likely to get to this any time soon. PRs welcome.

@brikis98 I'm looking at submitting a PR to solve this. There are stack and stack sets and sets can contain stacks, would you all rather there be a type like `cf-stackset` and `cf-stack` and just ensure we delete all sets before stacks or would you all rather it be implemented like the VPC nuke code where we just know X resources have to be nuked before the VPC can finally be deleted? 

It's possible to delete stacks without stacksets only if the sets don't refer to the stacks being deleted.

Closing this PR as we've not made any changes or updates since 2021.
