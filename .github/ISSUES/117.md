# Homebrew support

**chenrui333** commented *May 24, 2020*

Just FYI, I have added one formula for this tool in the homebrew side (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/55228)

@brikis98 yeah, I need a new release to kick if off again (not sure if you can make one anytime soon :) )

@brikis98 if possible, can I get a new release so that I can proceed with the homebrew formula? This would be a great tool for lots of homebrew users.

Done! Binaries should show up shortly. https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/releases/tag/v0.1.19

Have merged homebrew-core PR for a while.

Here is my installation log for the brew formula.

==> Caveats
Before you can use these tools, you must export some variables to your $SHELL.
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY="<Your AWS Access ID>"
  export AWS_SECRET_KEY="<Your AWS Secret Key>"
  export AWS_REGION="<Your AWS Region>"
==> Summary

```

With that being said, closing this issue tracker. Thanks!
