# Querying for IAM resources appears to be failing

Need to look into querying for IAM roles and policies. Currently not getting back expected IAM roles that exist in a test when using a Query. 

Check if it's because they're global resources?

Closed as I'm no longer working at Gruntwork and since the issue was stale enough that it likely need revalidation / may no longer be true.
