# New feature: ability to delete SNS Topic

**rafaelleonardocruz** commented *Jan 6, 2021*

I've been using `cloud-nuke` to purge all resources created in test AWS accounts. One of the projects creates a bunch of SNS Topic, and I realized that SNS Topic deletion is not supported.

I'm opening this issue because I would like to implement this feature.

Thanks for the project, it's pretty useful. +1
