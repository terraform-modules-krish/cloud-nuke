# Feature Request: add ability to delete users, groups, and policies

**queglay** commented *May 17, 2020*

For each deployment and test I create new users, with a pipeline id in the user name, since tags can't be used.

It would be awesome if we could use a regex to clean out resources like users if they matched.

A PR to add support for deleting IAM resources (users, groups, policies) is welcome. See also https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/108 for more ability to match on regex and other more complex patterns.

As of today, we have the ability to nuke IAM Users and they can be filtered using the config file. I am leaving this issue open because we still don't support IAM Groups and Policies.

A great step nonetheless, thanks!
