# How to skip approve prompt?

**ukreddy-erwin** commented *Apr 26, 2022*

When I ran the below command.

cloud-nuke aws --region us-west-2

It is asking to approve yes/no with a prompt.

How to skip that, so that we can keep it as part of gitlab pipeline?

Also, any option to filter resources based on a tag in a particular region and delete them?
