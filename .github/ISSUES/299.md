# New feature: ability to delete CloudTrail trails

**TryTryAgain** commented *Apr 27, 2022*

Likely related to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/212 (although I didn't experience this issue in some quick recent tests; maybe the accounts/activity was too small) ... 

But, I didn't see any feature request to add CloudTrail trails specifically. It would be very helpful to add the CloudTrail service to the list of supported services for `cloud-nuke`.
