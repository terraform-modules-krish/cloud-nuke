# Update cloud-nuke config file to support all existing resources

**brikis98** commented *Jan 18, 2021*

We recently added support for configuring `cloud-nuke` via a config file, but this feature only supported a [few of the resources](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke#whats-supported). We should update `cloud-nuke` to support filtering all other resources via the config file.
