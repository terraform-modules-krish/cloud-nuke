# New feature: ability to delete Transit Gateway

**rafaelleonardocruz** commented *Jan 6, 2021*

I've been using `cloud-nuke` to purge all resources created in test AWS accounts. One of the projects creates a bunch of Transit Gateways, and I realized that Transit Gateway deletion is not supported.

I'm opening this issue because I would like to implement this feature.

Thanks for the project, it's pretty useful. +1
