# New feature: ability to delete IAM roles 

**zackproser** commented *Aug 13, 2020*

To assist with hitting the IAM roles limit in AWS - we could use the ability to delete IAM roles - but to also provide a list of roles that should be preserved and not deleted.

I think we'd want to support specifying regular expressions for which IAM roles to delete via the config file.

Related to #116, which addresses IAM users and policies

@zackproser I see you've had some thoughts here and assigned @rhoboat. I wonder what's the latest on this issue? Is there any action for us to take?

@ina-stoyanova Hmm, from looking through internal messages it seems we initially were planning to use this one as a trial project? I'm not sure now why I assigned it to Rho - unless they were going to take a look at this?

Hm, ok! Thanks for sharing! 

I think in that case, I'll leave this issue open, as it's still a desired feature.

Support for IAM Roles and regex matching via config file were added in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/330
