# Consider AWS Cloud Control API to simplify code, expand supoorted resources

**zackproser** commented *Jul 28, 2022*

We've considered refactoring cloud-nuke to use the [AWS Cloud Control API](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/). 

**Motivation**:  Using Cloud Control for cloud-nuke would theoretically mean that cloud-nuke would support all AWS resources that can currently by managed by cloud control immediately, and receive ongoing support for new resources that AWS adds - without Grunts or community members needing to contribute pull requests to unlock each resource. 

At Gruntwork, we've gone so far as to do an experiment, forking cloud-nuke off (https://github.com/zackproser/cloud-nuke) and rewriting it to use the Cloud Control SDK methods. At the present moment, we have the following findings: 

**Findings:**
- **cloud-control is very slow**
   - It took significantly longer to remove a small set of resources when cloud-nuke is backed by cloud-control, than it does to issue the `DELETE` API calls directly, without using cloud-control. This would add an intolerable delay to all cloud-nuke operations.
- **Resources cannot be deleted**
    - IAM Roles fail to be deleted if they have policies still attached. There’s no way to signal that you want this done.
    - S3 Buckets fail to be deleted if they are not empty. There is no force parameter exposed.
    - We could implement the same supplementary logic we have in the original cloud-nuke, such as emptying buckets prior to deleting them, or detaching all policies from IAM roles before deleting them. However, if we do this - aren’t we back to where we were before with the original cloud nuke and having to specially treat every edge case of every service manually? Perhaps this is fine and - even with implementing this logic - we’d still be in a far better position in terms of overall lines of code to maintain, etc.
- **Key resources are missing**
    - We do get a great deal more resources out of the box with Cloud Control, but, painfully, several key resources are not yet supported by Cloud Control, such as EC2 Instances and IAM Users.
- **Rate limiting**
    - As Cloud Control’s own docs specify, a single request to cloud control will likely generate several resource requests under the hood. As a result, even when specifying only a few resource type targets, I’ve seen ListResources API limits being hit in local development / testing
- [The official Hashicorp Cloud Control AWS provider is still in technical preview](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-awscc), and is not recommended for production usage.
- **There is a long coverage roadmap, with zero public commitments as to timing**, but at least it exists: [https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-coverage-roadmap/projects/1](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-coverage-roadmap/projects/1)
- **Posts to the same effect:**
    - From our friends at Steampipe - [a deep dive into AWS Cloud Control for asset inventory](https://steampipe.io/blog/aws-cloud-control)](https://steampipe.io/blog/aws-cloud-control) 
    - [The Cloud Control API is not for you](https://www.fernandomc.com/posts/the-aws-cloud-control-api-is-not-for-you/)

Our current plans are to park this work, but keep an eye on Cloud Control developments over time. As Cloud Control begins to cover more key resources and the documentation and stability improves, we should re-consider cutting over to it to simplify this code base and its maintenance.

I'm no longer working at Gruntwork and while this info is useful as an experiment, I'll leave it up to the current team to either consider / re-open as needed.
