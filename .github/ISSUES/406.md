# I have added --exclude-resource-type iam in the nuke command but still see lot of Iam resorces are getting delted.

I see below Iam resources are getting deleted even after adding '--exclude-resource-type iam ' to the command.

Is it bug or I am doing any thing wrong?

Is there any way I can exclude entire IAM stuff including roles, polices etc.

Hi @sreenusuuda the `iam` type refers to IAM Users. IAM roles, groups, and policies have their own resource type tags. try adding `--exclude-resource-type iam-role`, `--exclude-resource-type iam-group` and `--exclude-resource-type iam-policy` to your command
