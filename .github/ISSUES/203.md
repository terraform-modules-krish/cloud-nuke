# Add support for me-south-1, eu-south-1, and af-south-1

At the moment, running cloud-nuke against any of these regions results in:
```
ERROR: Failed to select regions: Invalid values for region: [[eu-south-1]]
```

Is this region enabled in your account? What command are you running?

We try to get all enabled regions within an account. What does `aws ec2 describe-regions` return for you?

Good question. I switched over to using aws-nuke, so I'm not sure. Will re-open if I encounter the issue again.
