# Update GuardDuty Detector deletion pattern 

**zackproser** commented *Jul 7, 2022*

Ideally, we should update the GuardDuty Detector deletion logic to mimic: 
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/aws/nat_gateway.go#L63

In case there are many Detectors in a given region. Also, determine how many Detectors can exist simultaneously.

Closed as I'm no longer working at Gruntwork and the issue is stale / may no longer be relevant.
