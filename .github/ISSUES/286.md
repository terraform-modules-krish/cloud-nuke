# ERROR: could not find any enabled regions

**fintaro123** commented *Mar 9, 2022*

Hi Guys!

I made a free account last year and I was planning to use cloud-nuke (via my Windows terminal) to delete all my resources but I got the following message: 

ERROR: could not find any enabled regions

after I enter the command: cloud-nuke aws

I am a completely newbie and I just want to close my free account but it seems so hard..

PS: I made a new user in IAM and added AdministratorAccess.

Could someone help me?


<br />

Hello,
based on error, `cloud-nuke` failed to describe available AWS regions, it may be an issue with passed credentials

It did not work for me on Windows, no matter how I've tried to pass the credentials. It did work on Linux though with a simple aws configure.

I have had the same experience. running from Windows 10 and 11 in pwsh and cmd. Cloud-nuke would not detect the login credential variables and would just fail to connect and discover regions. running on ubuntu or mac and I've had no issues.

Add `aws_region = ap-south-1` (or whatever region) on my aws credential config file works for me

`vi ~/.aws/credentials`

```
[user1]
aws_access_key_id = my_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = my_secret_access_key
aws_region = ap-south-1
```

Deletion of multiple regions resources works anyway even if you have only one region on credential config file

`cloud-nuke aws --region ap-south-1 eu-central-1 eu-north-1`

and you can scan and delete resources on all regions too

`cloud-nuke aws`

For me the solution for this was to only have an `~/.aws/credentials` file.
Whenever the env vars are set it is in conflict with the creds file. Maybe a flag to choose precedence would be nice?
