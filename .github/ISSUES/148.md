# EKS nuke should first identify nodegroups attached to the EKS cluster. 

**andrewpsp** commented *Nov 1, 2020*

Since the EKS cluster has nodegroups attached to the target cluster, the nuking fails for this resource with `ResourceInUseException`. This is a request to also delete nodegroups prior to destroying the EKS cluster.

That would indeed be helpful. I'm not sure when we'll get to it, so a PR is very welcome!

Also related is https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/111 (Fargate profiles). Would be nice to implement both at once.
