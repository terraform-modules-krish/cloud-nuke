# Nicer logs for CI executions

**carldjohnston** commented *Aug 28, 2023*

Good morning wonderful gruntworkers,

We are nuking our test environments with cloud-nuke, running from a github action, which is working nicely.

Unfortunately we see 1000's of lines of output from the "Retrieving active AWS resources" message spinner in our actions log. https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/2d031b4772b0c5c2827d552b5455fb3e97ed21fd/commands/cli.go#L296

Is there a way we could disable the spinner, or get a simpler output mode for use in automation?

Thank you!

Carl

We've also found this annoying internally and have plans to add a flag to enable a more machine-readable output. No ETA yet unfortunately. That being said, PRs are always welcome!
