# Removal of dedicated hosts

Noticed that `cloud-nuke` is not removing EC2 dedicated hosts, having removal of these resources will be a good reduction of AWS account bills

@denis256 Looks like we have [full support for EC2 dedicated hosts](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/aws/ec2_dedicated_host.go#L17) in the codebase already - did you mean the removal is failing?
