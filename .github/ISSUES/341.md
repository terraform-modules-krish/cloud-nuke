# Issue tearing down Elasticache in CIS-Benchmark Ref Arch

**zackproser** commented *Aug 1, 2022*

As observed with @pete0emerson when nuking a CIS-Benchmark compliant Ref Arch:

`[cloud-nuke] ERRO[2022-08-01T10:38:11-07:00] [Failed] InvalidCacheClusterState: Cannot delete the cache cluster since it is the only member of a replication group. Delete the replication group instead.`
