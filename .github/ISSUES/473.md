# Circle CI Test Pipeline Broken

**hongil0316** commented *Jun 10, 2023*

The Circle CI test pipeline seems to be broken: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke?branch=test_branch
* Triggered the test pipeline without any changes. 

Looking at it briefly, it seems like we are hitting the test failure due to some quota issue: 

TestNukeIamGroups:
```
LimitExceeded: Cannot exceed quota for GroupsPerAccount: 300
        	            		status code: 409, request id: 3183d157-fa07-4de9-8650-6ec6f732e413
```

Also, interesting thing I noticed is that a lot of the tests were paused probably because of this issue:

For instance, here is the detail log for one of the failing test

This is fixed now. Closing.
