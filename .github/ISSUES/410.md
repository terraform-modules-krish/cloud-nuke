Error messages get cut off in the table view and there's no way to view the full message.  I believe I should have access to these config rules, but nuke doesn't want to remove them.

I ran in to the same issue, disabling Security Hub removed the config service rules from my account.

Cannot reproduce the same issue right now. Looking into it though. 

It seems like there's another related issue looking at this error message: 

```
‚ùå ResourceInUseException: The rule iam-user-unused-credentials-check currently has a RemediationConfiguration. Please delete the RemediationConfiguration and try again.
```

It seems like we need to also remove `RemediationConfiguration` if a config rule has it.
