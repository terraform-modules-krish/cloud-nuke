# Cleanup is not complete.

**ukreddy-erwin** commented *Apr 25, 2022*

I ran the nuke script as below.

`cloud-nuke aws --region us-west-2`

Cleanup is 80% done but it is not deleting below resources.

VPC (Not default, custom one created) and linked routing tables,subnets,etc
Internet gateway (Not default, custom one created)
Elastic IPs

Also, any option to filter resources based on a tag in a particular region and delete them?

Filter based on a tag is now supported in a subset of resources. 
Unsupported resource types won't be deleted as part of the nuke operation unfortunately. 

We welcome PRs to implement nuking behaviour for additional resources.
