# Improve messaging when there is no downloaded binary

**pete0emerson** commented *Aug 2, 2022*

In #338 I neglected to add the `v` to my version when specifying `--tag 0.16.2`.

The messaging should be improved; in other words, if there is no tag, then we should not see the message that I saw:

`Moving /tmp/gruntwork-script-modules/cloud-nuke_darwin_amd64 to /usr/local/bin/cloud-nuke and setting execute permissions`

This is misleading, because moving insinuates that the binary actually exists.

Can we detect the existence of the tag, and show something like:

`There is no tag 0.16.2`?

I think this is more an issue for `gruntwork-install` (and probably `fetch`?), so we should move it there!

Ah, yes, that's right. I'll move it.
