# KMS Customer Key deletion should support config file

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 1, 2022*

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/257 added support for nuking KMS keys, but it did not add support for fine grained include/exclude via config files. We should update the feature to support defining include/exclude rules for the KMS keys, using the KMS key alias as the name.

For example, I should be able to specify the following in the nuke config to ensure our `dedicated-test-key` is never deleted:

```
KMSCustomerKeys:
  exclude:
    names_regex:
      - dedicate-test-key
```
