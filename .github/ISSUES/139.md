# Update cloud-nuke config to delete S3 buckets in Gruntwork Phx DevOps accounts

**brikis98** commented *Oct 9, 2020*

We shouldn't delete ALL buckets in that account, as some _might_ still be important (Acme? Analytics? Training? Terraform Up & Running stuff?), so we should specify it using a filter that specifies specific regex patterns. See [here for starting patterns](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/prototypes/blob/master/aws-gc/aws-gc.py#L517-L520).

This looks like it's been done. https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/.circleci/nuke_config.yml#L3-L16. Thanks, Yori!
