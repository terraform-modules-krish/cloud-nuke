# Add region excludes to defaults-aws

**jmorsecode** commented *Dec 6, 2019*

In the case that 90% of the regions are unused but need to be CIS remediated before being disabled completely, it would help greatly to be able to nuke default-aws --exclude-region X in similar fashion to the standard nuke aws. Then at most the in use region can be manually remediated for CIS afterwards.
