What resources are missing? Can you provide more context?
***

**marinalimeira** commented *Sep 24, 2021*

Also, which version of cloud-nuke are you using? You can verify that running

```
cloud-nuke --version
```
***

**AlexanderWiechert** commented *Sep 24, 2021*

cloud-nuke version v0.5.0
***

**marinalimeira** commented *Sep 28, 2021*

@AlexanderWiechert is this issue still persisting? Were you able to nuke other resources by now?

If it still persists, what kind of resources are in your account that cloud nuke was not able to find?

I only was able to delete stuff when I ommit the region flag.
