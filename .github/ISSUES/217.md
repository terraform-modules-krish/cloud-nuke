# Add a test to ensure CircleCI configs are parsable 

**infraredgirl** commented *Oct 12, 2021*

We've had a situation where a bad CircleCI config has broken the build, and it wasn't caught at PR merge time due to lack of tests. We should add some tests to ensure this does not happen again.

For more context, see #216 and #214.

The circle CI command line interface exposes `circleci config validate <config-path>` to make this simpler.
