# S3 Bucket removal failure

Noticed that cloud-nuke fails to remove S3 buckets in some cases:
```

Hey @denis256, can you describe how to reproduce this error message? 

I tried creating a test s3 bucket with versioning enabled and uploaded files multiple times with different contents (to produce different versions of the same file). Then, I ran the following command to delete the test s3 files: 

```
gruntwork vault exec rasbox-shared -- cloud-nuke inspect-aws --resource-type s3
gruntwork vault exec rasbox-shared -- cloud-nuke aws --resource-type s3
```

The command above successfully deleted the s3 file.
