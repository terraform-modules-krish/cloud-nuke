Agreed! We haven't gotten to this yet—as well as some other high priority ones, such as RDS and ElastiCache—but PRs are very welcome :)

@brikis98 would love to implement this one. Won't commit until I have the time for it, though :)

Just tested #36 and it works perfect. ECS Cluster deletion issue is a non-issue in terms of cloud-nuke and documented - marking this issue as closed. Thanks @yorinasub17!
