# Nuke VPC endpoint services

**wjam** commented *Mar 6, 2019*

VPC endpoint services, not VPC endpoints directly, as they may be fronting NLBs spun up during testing. As part of deleting the VPC endpoint services, any existing endpoint connections would need to be rejected.

My reasoning for not targeting VPC endpoints is that, in my case, they are potentially tied into how the VPC is designed - such as allowing communication to AWS APIs without going onto the big-wide internet
