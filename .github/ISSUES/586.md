# S3- Inconsistent/incorrect config key

**sbocinec** commented *Sep 13, 2023*

 [cloud-nuke documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/92f09d2aa30fde92b9141677da85053218badcec/README.md#whats-supported) states that all the config file config key starts with a capital letter, including `s3` resource type, which config key should be `S3`.

Though, for `s3` resource type, only lowercase config key `s3` is a valid config option.

To make it clear, I suggest to rename `s3` config key to `S3` to be consistent with the other config keys. Changing the key, is a major breaking change though. Until then, I suggest to at least fix the doc (I'm going to ship a PR to address this)
