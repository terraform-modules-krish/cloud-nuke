# Feature: Add ability to nuke OpenSearch Service Domains

**yorinasub17** commented *Nov 13, 2021*

We have a bunch of leftover OpenSearch Service Domains in phxdevops, which accumulate to a good amount of money, so we should add the ability to nuke them through cloud-nuke.

Note that the API for OpenSearch service has the following limitations:

- It does not give a create timestamp, so time based filtering will need to rely on the tagging pattern we use for ECS Clusters.
- It does not provide a bulk delete API, so we will need to rely on the goroutine based concurrent deletion pattern we use for NAT Gateways.
