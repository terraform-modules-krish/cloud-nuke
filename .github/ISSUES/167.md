# Deleting DynamoDB tables

**fredrb** commented *Jan 1, 2021*

I've been using `cloud-nuke` to purge all resources created in test AWS accounts. One of the projects creates a bunch of DynamoDB tables, and I realized that DynamoDB deletion is not supported. 

Is this something you plan to implement? Or is not implemented on purpose? 

Thanks for the project, it's pretty useful. :+1:

I think you can do this by calling list tables api and adding each table to a slice to be deleted. Looking into this.

@brikis98 @DMEvanCT  is this something that hasn't been implemented? If so I'd gladly like to have a go at it
