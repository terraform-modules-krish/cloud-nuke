# Limit defaults-aws to security groups only

**jmorsecode** commented *Dec 6, 2019*

In the case of default VPCs that are still in use, a user should still be able to remediate for CIS by blanking the default security groups. An option on defaults-aws to exclude VPC destruction would allow this.  Currently I do not see any AWS CIS requirements for removing all default VPCs. Only that the default security group restricts all traffic and others do not openly allow RDP or SSH.
