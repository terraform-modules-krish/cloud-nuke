# Aws-nuke fails on Deleting EBS Volumes

**josh-padnick** commented *Feb 18, 2018*

While doing a fresh `aws-nuke` run, I received the following error:

```

This makes me realize that part of deleting an EBS Volume means repeatedly checking that it has in fact been detached before initiating its termination.

Also, re-running the tool still doesn't fix this issue, so I guess it's assuming that only EBS Volumes that have been manually detached should be deleted? That seems like an unreasonable expectation of a user who wants to "nuke" their account.

This also makes me realize that you should only attempt to detach EBS Volumes from EC2 Instances that do not have EC2 Instance Termination protection.

Sorry for the repeated messages here, but, unfortunately `aws-nuke` is not really usable in its current state :( since repeated runs yield the same issue:

```
Are you sure you want to nuke all listed resources? Enter 'nuke' to confirm: nuke

```

I suspect the issue here is that an EC2 Instance in `eu-west-1` has termination protection so `aws-nuke` shouldn't be attempting to delete its volume.
