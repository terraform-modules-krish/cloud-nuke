Thanks for the bug report! This should definitely be fixed, but I'm not sure when we'll have time to address it. If you would like to submit a PR with a fix, that would be greatly appreciated!

Hi @infraredgirl i run into the same problem, if you wish i will create a PR. 

As a suggestion, I would put policy deletion between object deletion and bucket deletion.

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/aws/s3.go

```go		
err = nukeAllS3BucketObjects(svc, bucketName, objectBatchSize)
if err != nil {
	logging.Logger.Errorf("[Failed] - %d/%d - Bucket: %s - object deletion error - %s", bucketIndex+1, totalCount, *bucketName, err)
	multierror.Append(multiErr, err)
	continue
}

// Here we delete the bucket policy that can prevent the deletion of the bucket itself
err = nukeS3BucketPolicy(svc, bucketName)
if err != nil {
	logging.Logger.Errorf("[Failed] - %d/%d - Bucket: %s - bucket policy deletion error - %s", bucketIndex+1, totalCount, *bucketName, err)
	multierror.Append(multiErr, err)
	continue
}


err = nukeEmptyS3Bucket(svc, bucketName, verifyBucketDeletion)
if err != nil {
	logging.Logger.Errorf("[Failed] - %d/%d - Bucket: %s - bucket deletion error - %s", bucketIndex+1, totalCount, *bucketName, err)
	multierror.Append(multiErr, err)
	continue
}
```
