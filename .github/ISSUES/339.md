# Investigate EKS autoscaling groups deletion behavior

**zackproser** commented *Aug 1, 2022*

As observed with @pete0emerson today, EKS ASG's can take upwards of 10 minutes to delete with 4 instances. ECS was much quicker. What's the difference here?

I suspect the issue is because for EKS, you need to tear down a dedicated resource (Managed Node Groups), which has more resources tied to it than just the ASG. I don't think there is anything we can do here - there's just more stuff that AWS needs to manage (and thus destroy) for EKS.

Going to close this given the context.
