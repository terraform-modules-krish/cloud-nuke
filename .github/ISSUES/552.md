# cloud-nuke s3 fails deleting buckets that are not empty

**kate-syberspace** commented *Aug 10, 2023*

version=v0.32.0
Command ran:
```
cloud-nuke aws \
  --resource-type s3 \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --config my/config_file \
  --older-than 200h
  --log-level debug
```

As the title suggests, this command fails to delete buckets that are not empty.  It also ignores the `log-level` flag, so I can't see the reasons why it's failing to delete the objects in the bucket.

At the end of the run I get:
` INFO  No resources touched in this run.`

Even though it's found resources to nuke:
`THE FOLLOWING 36 AWS RESOURCES WILL BE NUKED:`


Occasionally I get this, which I'm not sure how to interpret, since the header says `Deleted Successfully`, but I see errors
```
 Identifier                                            | Resource Type | Deleted Successfully                       |

Hi @kate-syberspace, I'm trying to reproduce the issue that you are facing. Can you share the exact configuration of the s3 file you were trying to delete? 

Specifically these: 
* object version 
* markers
* prefixes/subdirectories
* lifecycle policies
* cross-region replication

These you have one or more of these configured/associated with the s3 bucket?
