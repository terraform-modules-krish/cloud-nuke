# Feature Request - Removing AWS Config and AWS Config Rules

**marklehmann26** commented *Sep 11, 2019*

Just wondering if you are looking to in the future add support for removing all config rules.

Use Case would be if anyone has been playing with config rules and setup and forgot any rules they have configured and are being triggered will cause additional charges to users accounts.

It would be good if the tool could also clear these out so if someone wanted to start their account from scratch they can.

Thoughts anyone?

Are you referring to AWS Config? If so, that sounds like a reasonable addition. PR welcome!

Hi, @brikis98 yeah AWS config, apologies I forgot to add this to the title.

FYI, would need to also clean up the delivery-channel as well: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/manage-delivery-channel.html "The AWS Config console does not provide the option to delete the delivery channel, so you must use the AWS CLI, the AWS Config API, or one of the AWS SDKs."

Closing this issue out given the fact we have implemented it already. See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/75137b08f0b7d565026557ffa3f8259c59d7fcff/aws/resources/config_service.go#L67
