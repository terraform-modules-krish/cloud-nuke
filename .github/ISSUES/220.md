# Go 1.15+ no longer support Darwin 32 bit binaries

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Oct 18, 2021*

[From the Go official release notes:](https://golang.org/doc/go1.15)
```
Darwin
As announced in the Go 1.14 release notes, Go 1.15 requires macOS 10.12 Sierra or later; support for previous versions has been discontinued.

As announced in the Go 1.14 release notes, Go 1.15 drops support for 32-bit binaries on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS (the darwin/386 and darwin/arm ports). Go continues to support the 64-bit darwin/amd64 and darwin/arm64 ports.
```

I believe the best way forward is to drop these from the support & release a breaking change. Any thoughts? @infraredgirl @marinalimeira

This is currently breaking the builds here: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/5094/workflows/93ab5e5c-c159-4eeb-80e8-d4bebfb7c992/jobs/25956

Should we keep to the Go 1.14 version instead?

Check our other Go repos such as Terragrunt and the history of their CircleCi configs. I believe we updated our `terraform-aws-ci` scripts to no longer build the 32 bit version, but to now build ARM versions, so upgrading should fix it.

Thanks! Took an initial stab at the resolution here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/pull/221

I just realized that the bug, as described, is probably not the issue with the build. I'm looking at the log output again from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/issues/220#issuecomment-946028413 and I see that the issue has nothing to do with 32-bit darwin, since it's not trying to build that:

```
-->   windows/amd64: github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke
-->    darwin/arm64: github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke
-->       linux/386: github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke
-->     linux/arm64: github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke
-->     windows/386: github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke
-->     linux/amd64: github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke
-->    darwin/amd64: github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke
```

Note that there is no `darwin/386`. So this may have been a red herring. In any case, I am going to close this and open a new one regarding the build instability.
