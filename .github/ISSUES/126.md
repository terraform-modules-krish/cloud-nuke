Do you have any plan do support China Region(cn-north-1, cn-northwest-1)?

We do not currently use those regions (not even sure our AWS accounts have access to them?), so we have not looked into what it would take to add support for them. Any idea what's involved?

China region and global region are completely independent. There is no way to use the services of the China region by using a global region account. Consider applying for an account in China Region.
