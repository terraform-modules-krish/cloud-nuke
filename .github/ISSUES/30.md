# Introducing you to AWSweeper (a similar tool)

**jckuester** commented *May 7, 2018*

Hi there,

it looks like the problem of trying to clean out Cloud accounts is present everywhere :-) -- I also started working on it last year, so I wanted show you what I've got (a tool named [AWSweeper](https://github.com/cloudetc/awsweeper/)).

Maybe it's helpful for you to reuse some code, fork it and drive it, or contribute (not sure if it's smart for me to continue AWSweeper as a one-man show, which it currently is). Anyway, here are some thoughts behind the tool I wanted to share with you:

* It currently supports deletion of **29 resource types** (but there are so many more). Therefore, I followed a generic approach (via reflection) to easily support deletion of more types out of the box, where only some API information of go-aws-sdk routines to list and delete resources needs to be added to a config array ([pointer to code](https://github.com/cloudetc/awsweeper/blob/master/resource/supported.go#L74)).

* It is built upon the existing delete methods of the [AWS terraform provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws) ([pointer to some code](https://github.com/cloudetc/awsweeper/blob/master/command/wipe.go#L136)). I thought this might be helpful to get retries, detaching of some policies etc. from IAM resources, "forcing" of deletion where dependencies exist, and other stuff, for free.

* Integration tests for each resource type using the [Terraform testing framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/helper/resource/testing.go) ([pointer to the tests](https://github.com/cloudetc/awsweeper/tree/master/test)).

* I also started with a all-or-nothing-wipe-out approach, but then realised that it's handy to sometimes keep some resources (e.g. an IAM user + credentials to access the account). So, with AWSweeper one can filter resources by type, tags or ids described in a yaml config (see [here](https://github.com/cloudetc/awsweeper#filter-resources-for-deletion)). I have the idea to make filtering also more generic, i.e, allow filtering on all attributes available about a resource (such as creation date, etc), returned via the output struct of the Go API.

Thanks for reading & cheers,
Jan

Hi @jckuester ðŸ‘‹  

Thanks for pointing us at AWSweeper. It does indeed look like a very similar tool! There are some great ideas in it:

- Support for a `--dry-run` flag. We obviously should have this in `cloud-nuke`!
- Ability to target by IDs, tags, etc. That's something we discussed adding. However, for now, our primary motivation is cleaning out an account where we run tests with [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest), and the primary filter we use there is age: i.e., delete everything that's more than 1 day old. 
- Using Terraform providers to do the resource deletion is a very clever idea :)
- What advantages do you see in using the Terraform testing framework?

Given our desire to support GCP and Azure deletion in the future, I'm not sure if we'll fork or drive AWSweeper, but we'd love to borrow ideas from it where we can, and very much welcome contributions to `cloud-nuke`.

Also, @tonerdo, could you add an "alternatives" section to the README? It should be a list of other tools people may want to check out, such as AWSSweeper, and some of the others you found while doing research around this. Thanks!

Thanks for your response, @brikis98 !

The Terraform testing framework just provides some convenient helper methods for integration testing: to spin up resources (described in terraform code) for tests, to test whether they still exist after running AWSweeper, etc. - which can probably all be done much more elegant way now with terratest. I am happy that it's open-sourced now :-)

fwiw, we've been doing this (delete/nuke sandboxes envs) with https://github.com/capitalone/cloud-custodian (also w/ support for gcp & azure).

@kapilt, 
    I have been looking at c7n for the purposes of deleting everything within sanboxes,I come across several stop/terminate templates based on filters etc.. can u point me to specific c7n documentation I can follow for cleanup of all resources? I assume the general approach is to create a policy with all resources types with wide open filter that would select all instances of a given resource type and terminate.. am i on the right track?

There is no action to take, so closing. It's good to know about other similar tools :)
