# Add dry-run mode

**asyd** commented *Nov 7, 2019*

Hi, 

as you mentioned on #30 you should add a `--dry-run` mode.

I must confess I switch to `awseeper` because dry mode is missing

Regards

Dry run mode sounds like a good feature to add.

With that said, we are unlikely to get to this any time soon since we typically use `cloud-nuke` in CI environments so `--dry-run` isn't necessary for us and we are buried at the moment with other priorities.

In the mean time, we would be happy to review any PRs if anyone needs this and is willing to contribute!
