# Could we simplify making AWS API calls with paging?

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Oct 29, 2021*

**Context:** 
In quite a few of our `aws` functions we have to make a batched call into AWS API to get some data (E.g. `s3` module & `dynamodb`, and others). 

**Question:** Is it possible to extract this logic somehow? E.g. so not every module has to figure out how to paging and batch calls on its own?
