# No assets uploaded to v0.13.0 release

**jbpratt** commented *Jul 19, 2022*

Hi, it appears there have been no build assets uploaded to the latest release https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/releases/tag/v0.13.0 like previous releases https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/releases/tag/v0.12.3 

cc @zackproser as the one performing the release

closing as the latest release as assets tied to it :smiley_cat: thanks for the silent fix!

@jbpratt Yes, there's a delay each time we cut a new release as our job to build and attach cross-platform binaries completes a few minutes later.

@zackproser for what its worth, it must have failed for the v0.13.0 release https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/releases/tag/v0.13.0

Yup indeed, there was a failure. I just fixed this and binaries should be available on `v0.13.0` now. Sorry for the troubles!
