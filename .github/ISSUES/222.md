# cloud-nuke build is unstable

**yorinasub17** commented *Oct 19, 2021*

The build stage frequently fails for what appears to be resource constraints. See https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/5094/workflows/93ab5e5c-c159-4eeb-80e8-d4bebfb7c992/jobs/25956 for example.

We should attempt to stabilize this by reducing the parallelism in gox.
