# How to schedule / use cloud-nuke non-interactive?

**fex01** commented *Oct 11, 2023*

Sorry for the complete noob question - but how do I use cloud-nuke non-interactive? How to skip the _type nuke to really delete everything_-dialog?

As far as I understand it, a large part of the value in cloud-nuke is the ability to schedule runs to make really sure that all resources in the test env got deleted? But either I'm overlooking something or neither the `--help` output nor the README is mentioning how to run cloud-nuke unsupervised?

I believe `--force` is the flag you are looking for. https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/master/commands/cli.go#L83. 

Did you try running `cloud-nuke aws --help` command?

Perfect - that's exactly what I was looking for 👍

Oh, that's the trick 😳 I did run `cloud-nuke --help` without the `aws`  addendum - which was not very helpful 😅
