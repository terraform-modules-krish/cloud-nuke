# AWS SSO (Identity Center) profile errors with "missing required configuration: sso_region, sso_start_url"

**hertzsprung** commented *Jul 1, 2023*

I use `aws --profile admin sso login` to authenticate with AWS.
`aws --profile admin sts get-caller-identity` successfully reports `arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_xxx/admin`.  All aws-cli commands work fine, as does CDK.

But cloud-nuke reports:
```
ERRO[2023-07-01T20:24:31+01:00] profile "admin" is configured to use SSO but is missing required configuration:
sso_region, sso_start_url  binary=cloud-nuke version=v0.31.2
```

My `./aws/config` is autogenerated by `aws configure` and looks like this:
```
[default]
region = eu-west-1
sso_session = default-sso
sso_account_id = 123456789012
sso_role_name = PowerUserAccess
[profile admin]
region = eu-west-1
sso_session = default-sso
sso_account_id = 123456789012
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
[sso-session default-sso]
sso_start_url = https://d-1234567890.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = eu-west-1
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

I've tried to copy-and-paste `sso_region` and `sso_start_url` into `[profile admin]` (even though I shouldn't need to), then I get a different error:
```
ERRO[2023-07-01T20:24:01+01:00] could not find any enabled regions            binary=cloud-nuke version=v0.31.2
```

I've tried exporting `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, and `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=true` but see the same error.

Hey @hertzsprung, have you tried using `aws-vault` with the profile. The command would look something like this once you configured the profile properly

aws-vault exec <profile_name> -- cloud-nuke command...

@hongil0316 there is no issue when running this via `aws-vault`.
However plain `cloud-nuke` fails to utilize `sso-session` from the config.

It looks similar to the issues I faced with terraform or packer
* https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-amazon/issues/350
* https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32465

And the solution there was to bump AWS SDK.

Confirmed this is working in the latest source build (57df2d5)

Hey @jakub-pietrzak, you continue to see the issue? Can you explain why we can reproduce the same issue? 
***

**jakub-pietrzak** commented *Oct 14, 2023*

@hongil0316 I have now checked and also confirm that this is working fine in the latest source build.

```
go run main.go aws --dry-run --region eu-central-1
```

The same however does not work in 0.32.0.
