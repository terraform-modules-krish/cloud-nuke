# cloud-nuke gcp

**acrisci** commented *Nov 28, 2018*

Hi,

I'm interested in using cloud-nuke for google cloud platform. I see it on the roadmap in the README. Are you accepting contributions for this feature?

We'd love contributions for GCP or any other cloud! We use the name `cloud-nuke` because we wantd to add other clouds, but we just haven't gotten around to it yet.

Might make some sense to look at doing this via Magic Modules:
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules
since a lot of the scaffolding (and information needed) is already there.

@josh-padnick I can take a look at whatâ€™s involved.

Also relevant - a gcloud CLI feature to list all resources. https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/resources/list

Is anybody looking/working on this?

**acrisci** commented *May 24, 2020*

I'm not working on it. Look at #45.

I wrote something rather quick in case anyone wants a look: https://github.com/arehmandev/gcp-nuke - happy for any contributors

Closing this issue as there seems to be other open source tools that tackle this problem and there are no immediate plans to implement this feature in cloud-nuke
