# New feature: support for deletion of SageMaker Notebook Instances

**jvanbuel** commented *Feb 11, 2022*

We heavily make use of SageMaker Notebook Instances for our AWS trainings. I got tired of manually deleting notebooks afterwards, and stumbled upon this project. Really cool, nice work!

Would you be interested in adding this functionality? I cobbled together a PR based on the code of other resources (mainly RDS, which has a very similar API).

This is now supported. Deleting it.
