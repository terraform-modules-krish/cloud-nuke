# Explore leveraging AWS resource explorer 

**zackproser** commented *Jan 16, 2023*

AWS announced a new service, Resource Explorer, for more easily and efficiently searching for your AWS Resources across regions. 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/resourceexplorer2/#CreateIndexInput

A cursory glance at the SDK suggests we may be able to use this for cloud-nuke to make the searching / resource identification phase much more efficient - and possibly do away with the redundant listing logic.
