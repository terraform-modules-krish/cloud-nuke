# EC2 Instances from Automated Tests Are Left Around

**josh-padnick** commented *Feb 21, 2018*

I'm pretty consistently seeing EC2 Instances in every region with names like:

* `aws-nuke-test-3nOZAN`
* `aws-nuke-test-iBLgDR`

It looks like `aws-nuke-test-3nOZAN` was launched at February 20, 2018 at 7:49:30 AM UTC-7, so I'm pretty confident that aws-nuke tests aren't cleaning up after themselves. Either that, or tests are continually failing, but it [doesn't look like that's the case](https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/aws-nuke), so the test clean up is probably the culprit.

To see for yourself, check out the PhxDevOps AWS account in any region.
