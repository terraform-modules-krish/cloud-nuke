I've hit this as well. It'd be nice to have an exponential backoff retry approach here.

Also, it may be worth prioritizing the EC2 Instances and Auto Scaling Groups first. Those are the most expensive, and this way, even if you've got a ton of AMIs -- as many AWS accounts do -- you can at least knock those out.

For example, in my use case, my goal was to clear out all the ASGs. But I kept hitting the AMI limit, which meant the tool isn't really usable for my use case. If I can knock out the ASGs but then it takes a long time on the AMIs, then I've at least achieved my objective.
