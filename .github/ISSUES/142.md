# TestFilterS3Bucket_Config/Exclude test failing

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Oct 13, 2020*

**Issue:**
This test seems to fail inconsistently. For examples, see here
[circleci1](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/1656/workflows/1577259a-4e9f-4d2e-8eb2-7a82665c1a84/jobs/21349)
[circleci2](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/1656/workflows/12a84e18-6299-4e98-bbf6-d30a4c3b0054/jobs/21347)

**What has been done so far:**
- After some investigation, we believe it might be due to other S3 buckets being created in parallel (by other tests) in the same region. 
- The test has been skipped with this issue as a reason: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/commit/4243cc9bfaf43355318d1d372f15ec0147ee6353

**Suggestions:**
The test might need to be changed to not rely on # of S3 buckets, as that will always be very flaky, depending on what else is running simultaneously.
