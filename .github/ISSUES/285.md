# Unable to delete VPC with active VPC endpoints

**sHesl** commented *Mar 3, 2022*

When attempting to delete a subnet with an active VPC endpoint, I'm seeing failures due to a `DependencyViolation` error, causing the whole VPC to fail to delete.

Sample output from me trying to delete a single VPC with a single subnet which contains 10 VPC endpoints:
```

```

Once all the endpoints were deleted, the subnet, and eventually the VPC, were successfully nuked.

Reordering the execution [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke/blob/93652812feb7c4764b984d128b8fe3457247c25b/aws/ec2.go#L397) to put `nukeEndpoints` before `nukeSubnets` should resolve this issue. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think there should be any`DependencyViolation`s introduced by moving the endpoints nuke to be the call immediately before nuking the subnets. 

It also looks like VPC endpoint deletion takes a while, and the subnet deletion won't succeed until these endpoints are  all cleared, so perhaps some polling will be needed to check the endpoints are _actually_ gone before continuing (has something similar been done for other resources?).

If that fix sounds sensible, I'd be happy to put together a PR.
