# In config how to exclude some resource only on specific region?

**mgzenitech** commented *May 22, 2023*

Hypothetical config:

```yaml
DynamoDB:
  exclude:
    names_regex:
      - TF-Locks
    region: ????
```
<br />

all the filters under the `exclude` works as `OR` operator, rather than `AND` operator. If you want to scope it to particular regions, you would have to use the `--region` flag to do it.
