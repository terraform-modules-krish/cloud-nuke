# Cloud-nuke exclude

**aizada92** commented *Oct 8, 2020*

Hey! is there any example yml files where you use exclude for cloudnuke? for some reason, our regex for ecsserv is not picking up. Working fine for s3, but not working for ecsserv and eip?

We only have preliminary support for the config file and regex format so far: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke#whats-supported. So, unfortunately, ECS is not going to work yet.
